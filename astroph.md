title: Detectability of Electromagnetic counterparts from Neutron Star mergers: prompt emission vs afterglow
authors: S Mohan, M Saleem, L Resmi
topic: We compare the detectability of prompt and afterglow emission from off-axis jets, assuming standard detector thresholds. We find that for top-hat jets, afterglow is a more potential counterpart than the prompt emission even with unfavorable afterglow parameters. For structured jets with a Gaussian profile, prompt emission is more promising than the afterglows at extreme viewing angles.

The extent to which spallation modifies the final NSM isotopic yields depends on: the ejected abundances, which are determined by the NSM astrophysical conditions and the properties of nuclei far from stability, the ejecta velocity distribution and propagation in interstellar matter, and the spallation cross-sections. Observed solar and stellar r-process yields could thus constrain the velocity distribution of ejected neutron star matter, assuming NSMs are the dominant r-process source

title: Towards a paradigm change in the main heavy r-process nucleosynthesis sites
authors: Aldana Grichener, Noam Soker 
topic: We study the basic properties of three possible r-process scenarios (sites) and compare them to recent observations and theoretical simulations. We find that the common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can account for the different observations of r-process nucleosynthesis, including the presence of r-process-rich low-metalicity stars in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The neutron star (NS)-NS merger scenario and the collapsar scenario encounter some difficulties. Despite that, we conclude that it is very likely that more than one r-process scenario exists, with a significant contribution by the CEJSN r-process scenario. We give a prescription to include this scenario in population synthesis studies of the r-process.

We develop a phase-agnostic likelihood model that uses only the spectral content for parameter estimation and demonstrate the calculation of a Bayesian upper limit in the absence of a signal.

authors: Tim Dietrich, Katy Clough
topic: we perform numerical relativity simulations of a binary neutron star merger, including a phenomenological description of the nucleon-nucleon-axion bremsstrahlung to quantify the effects of such a cooling channel on the dynamical evolution. While our simulations show a difference in the temperature profile of the merger remnant, the imprint of the axion via nucleon-nucleon-axion bremsstrahlung on the emitted gravitational wave signal and the ejecta mass is too small to improve constraints on the axion mass with current or future planned detectors. Whilst we consider a limited number of cases, and a simplified cooling model, these broadly represent the "best case" scenario, thus, a more thorough investigation is unlikely to change the conclusions, at least for this particular interaction channel.

We find that an extrapolation of the post-peak temporal slope of GW170817 to the luminosities of cosmological short GRBs matches their observed jet break times, suggesting that their explosion properties are similar, and that the primary difference in GW170817 is viewing angle.

title: Using failed supernovae to constrain the Galactic r-process element production
authors: B. Wehmeyer, C. Frohlich, B. Côté, M. Pignatari, F.-K. Thielemann
topic: The large scatter of r-process elements in the early Galaxy suggests that the r-process is made by rare events, like compact binary mergers and rare sub-classes of supernovae. Although being rare, neutron star mergers alone have difficulties to explain the observed enhancement of r-process elements in the lowest metallicity stars compared to Fe. In this work we investigate another complementary scenario, where the r-process occurs in neutron star-black hole mergers in addition to neutron star mergers. Neutron star-black hole mergers would eject similar amounts of r-process matter as neutron star mergers, but only the neutron star progenitor would have produced Fe.

The combination of dilution and small number statistics produces a large scatter in the expected r-process enrichment within a single UFD or classical dwarf galaxy. Comparison between our results and observed europium abundances reveals a tension that even a systematic choice of optimistic parameters in our models cannot release. Such a discrepancy could point to the need of additional r-process production sites that suffer less severe dilution or to a population of extremely fast merging binaries.

We show that the small but non-negligible optical depths lead to neutrino transport globally coupling the disk electron fraction, which we capture by solving the transport equation with a Monte Carlo method. The resulting absorption drives up the electron fraction in a structured, continuous outflow, with electron fraction as high as Ye∼0.4 in the extreme polar region. We show via nuclear reaction network and radiative transfer calculations that nucleosynthesis in the disk wind will produce a blue kilonova.

title: GW170817 Afterglow Reveals that Short Gamma-Ray Bursts are Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Yiyang Wu, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We systematically investigate the outflow structure of GW170817 in comparison with a sample of 27 cosmological short GRBs by modelling their afterglow light curves. We find that cosmological short GRBs share the same outflow structures with GW170817, relativistic structured jets. The similarity between the GW170817 outflow structure and those of cosmological short GRBs indicates that cosmological short GRBs are likely neutron star mergers.

title: Constraining coherent low frequency radio flares from compact binary mergers
authors: A. Rowlinson, G.E. Anderson
topic: For this paper, we constrain this coherent radio emission using the deepest available constraints for GRB 150424A, which were obtained via a triggered observation with the Murchison Widefield Array. We then expand this analysis to determine the properties of magnetar merger remnants that may be formed via a general population of binary neutron star mergers. Our results demonstrate that many of the potential coherent emission mechanisms that have been proposed for such events can be detected or very tightly constrained by the complementary strategies used by the current generation of low-frequency radio telescopes

authors: Alexander P. Ji, Maria R. Drout, Terese T. Hansen
topic: The lanthanide fraction (XLa) is a measurable quantity in both kilonovae and metal-poor stars, but it has not previously been explicitly calculated for stars. Here, we compute the lanthanide fraction distribution of metal-poor stars to enable comparison to current and future kilonovae. For neutron star mergers to remain viable as the dominant r-process site, future kilonova observations should be preferentially lanthanide-rich. These high-XLa kilonovae may be fainter and more rapidly evolving than GW170817, posing a challenge for discovery and follow-up observations

This allows us to (i) study the emerging structure and amplification of the magnetic field and observe a clear saturation at magnetic energy 10^51. We follow the magnetically supported expansion of the outer layers of the remnant NS and its evolution into an ellipsoidal shape without any surrounding torus. We also argue that the conditions at the end of the simulation disfavor later jet formation on subsecond timescales if no BH is formed.

authors: Gor Oganesyan, Stefano Ascenzi, Marica Branchesi, Om Sharan Salafia, Simone Dall'Osso, Giancarlo Ghirlanda
topic: Here we show that the high-latitude emission from a structured jet can naturally produce an X-ray plateau in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves, independent of the radiation from an external shock. We calculate the radiation from a switched-off shell featuring an angular structure in both its relativistic bulk motion and intrinsic brightness. Our model is able to explain the shallow decay phase (plateau) often observed in GRB X-ray light curves. We discuss the possible contribution of the structured jet high-latitude emission to other distinctive features of GRB X-ray light curves, and its capability to explain the chromatic optical/X-ray light curve properties.

topic: Here we investigate the use of fine-structure, line-binned opacities that preserve the integral of the opacity over frequency. Advantages of this area-preserving approach over the traditional expansion-opacity formalism include the ability to pre-calculate opacity tables that are independent of the type of hydrodynamic expansion and that eliminate the computational expense of calculating opacities within radiation-transport simulations. Tabular opacities are generated for all 14 lanthanides as well as a representative actinide element, uranium. We demonstrate that spectral simulations produced with the line-binned opacities agree well with results produced with the more accurate continuous Monte Carlo Sobolev approach, as well as with the commonly used expansion-opacity formalism

authors: N. Fraija, D. Lopez-Camara, A.C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, P. Veres, S. Dichiara
topic: We calculate the light curves obtained from an analytic model in which the synchrotron and SSC emission (in the fast- or slow-cooling regime) of an off-axis top-hat jet and a quasi-spherical outflow are decelerated in either a homogeneous or a wind-like circumburst medium. We show that the synchrotron emission of the quasi-spherical outflow is stronger than that of the off-axis jet during the first \sim 10 - 20 days, and weaker during the next \geq 80 days. For GRB 170817A, we find using our model that the synchrotron emission generated by the quasi-spherical outflow and off-axis top-hat jet increase.

Our models that fit the bolometric luminosity of AT 2017gfo (the kilonova associated with the first neutron star merger discovered in gravitational waves, GW170817) do not simultaneously fit the B, V, and I time evolution. However, we find that the trends of the evolution in B and V magnitudes are better matched by the fallback model relative to the pulsar model, implying the time dependence of the remnant source influences the color evolution.

To parameterize the nuclear EoS, we use a different approach, expanding from pure nuclear matter rather than from symmetric nuclear matter to make use of recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations.

In this case, in fact, the merger remnant has an excess angular momentum yielding a more extended and "colder" object, with reduced ability to shed mass dynamically.

We show that the accumulation of fissioning material during the r process can strongly affect the free neutron abundance after the r-process freeze-out.

The very low-Ye, fission-cycling ejecta of an r-process event need only constitute 10-30% of the total ejecta mass to accommodate most actinide abundances of metal-poor stars. We find that our empirical Ye distributions of ejecta are similar to those inferred from studies of GW170817 mass ejecta ratios, which is consistent with neutron-star mergers being a source of the heavy elements in metal-poor, r-process enhanced stars.

topic: Here, we perform a set of simulations of low-mass NSBH mergers, including systems compatible with GW170817. Our simulations use a composition and temperature dependent equation of state (DD2) and approximate neutrino transport, but no magnetic fields. We find that low-mass NSBH mergers produce remnant disks significantly less massive than previously expected, and consistent with the post-merger outflow mass inferred from GW170817 for moderately asymmetric mass ratio. The dynamical ejecta produced by systems compatible with GW170817 is negligible except if the mass ratio and black hole spin are at the edge of the allowed parameter space. That dynamical ejecta is cold, neutron-rich, and surprisingly slow for ejecta produced during the tidal disruption of a neutron star.

topic: Although high-energy neutrinos were not detected from this event, mergers of neutron stars are expected to produce such high-energy particles. Relativistic jets are launched when neutron stars merge. If the jets contain protons, they can emit high-energy neutrinos through photomeson production. In addition, neutron star mergers produce massive and fast ejecta, which can be a source of Galactic high-energy cosmic rays above the knee.

This framework can be expressed using a set of five physically-motivated parameters that span a narrow range of values for realistic EOS and are able to capture the leading-order effects of degenerate matter on the thermal pressure.

title: The mass distribution of Galactic double neutron stars
authors: Nicholas Farrow, Xing-Jiang Zhu, Eric Thrane
topic: we perform Bayesian inference using a sample of 17 Galactic double neutron stars effectively doubling the sample used in previous studies. We show that precise component mass measurements of ≈20 double neutron stars are required in order to determine with high confidence (a Bayes factor of 150) if recycled and non-recycled neutron stars come from a common distribution. Approximately 60 are needed in order to establish the detailed shape of the distributions.

title: Constraints on Gamma-ray Burst Inner Engines in a Blandford-Znajek Framework
authors: Nicole M. Lloyd-Ronning, Chris Fryer, Jonah Miller, Neelima Prasad, Chris Torres, Phillip Martin
topic: Under the assumption that a Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) is ultimately produced by a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet from a highly spinning black hole BH, we put limits on the magnetic field and BH mass needed to power observed long and short GRBs. For BHs in the range. We also discuss the implications and consequences of high magnetic fields in GRB BH-disk systems, in terms of MRI field growth and magnetically arrested disks. Finally, we examine the conditions under which the progenitor systems can retain enough angular momentum to create BHs spinning rapidly enough to power BZ jets.

title: On the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability with smooth initial conditions -- Linear theory and simulations
authors: Thomas Berlok, Christoph Pfrommer
topic: we derive a linear theory for the KHI with smooth profiles and illustrate code testing with the MHD code Athena. We provide the linear solution for the KHI with smooth initial conditions in three different limits: inviscid hydrodynamics, ideal MHD and Braginskii-MHD. These linear solutions are obtained numerically with the framework Psecas (Pseudo-Spectral Eigenvalue Calculator with an Automated Solver), which generates and solves numerical eigenvalue problems using an equation-parser and pseudo-spectral methods. The Athena simulations are carried out on a periodic, Cartesian domain

title: Late time kilonova light curves and implications to GW 170817
authors: Eli Waxman, Eran O. Ofek, Doron Kushnir
topic: We discuss the late time (tens of days) emission from the radioactive ejecta of mergers involving neutron stars, when the ionization energy loss time of beta-decay electrons and positrons exceeds the expansion time. This universality of the late time behavior is due to the weak dependence of the ionization loss rate on composition and on e\mp energy. . The late time IR and optical measurements of GW 170817 are consistent with this expected behavior provided that the ionization loss time exceeds the expansion time at

title: Misaligned snowplough effect and the electromagnetic counterpart to black hole binary mergers
authors: Fabrícia A. C. Pereira, Giuseppe Lodato, Irapuan Rodrigues, Márcio E. S. Alves, Daniel J. Price
topic: We estimate the accretion rates produced when a circumprimary gas disc is pushed into the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH) by the tidal force of the decaying secondary during a SMBH merger. Using the 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We find that discs with small inclination angles (\leq 10 degrees) produce an increase in luminosity exceeding the Eddington rate. we show that the misaligned snowplough effect remains important even for angles larger than the disc aspect ratio. The rise in the accretion rate produced by discs inclined at small angles to the binary orbit can produce an electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational wave signal emitted from final stages of the binary orbital decay.

title: Charged Compact Binary Coalescence Signal and Electromagnetic Counterpart of Plunging BH-NS mergers
authors: Bing Zhang
topic: If at least one of the members of a compact binary coalescence is charged, the inspiral of the two members would generate a Poynting flux with an increasing power, giving rise to a brief electromagnetic counterpart temporally associated with the chirp signal of the merger (with possibly a small temporal offset), which we term as the {\em charged Compact Binary Coalescence} (cCBC) signal. We develop a general theory of cCBC for any mass and amount of charge for each member.

title: Properties of jet and surrounding material of GW/GRB~170817A
authors: Houri Ziaeepour
topic: We use published data in radio, optical and X-ray bands to analyze and model afterglows of GW/GRB 170817A. Our analysis is based on a phenomenological gamma-ray burst generator model which we previously used to study the prompt gamma-ray emission of this important transient. We find a multi-component model and a few of its variants that are consistent with broad band \sim 1 year observations of afterglows, once the contribution of kilonova in optical/IR band is taken into account. phenomenological models

title: A General-relativistic Determination of the Threshold Mass to Prompt Collapse in Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Sven Köppel, Luke Bovard, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: We study the lifetimes of the remnant produced by the merger of two neutron stars and revisit the determination of the threshold mass to prompt collapse, Mth. Using a fully general-relativistic numerical approach and a novel method for a rigorous determination of Mth, we show that a nonlinear universal relation exists between the threshold mass and the maximum compactness.
