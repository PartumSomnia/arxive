title: A magnetar engine for short GRBs and kilonovae
authors: Philipp Mösta, David Radice, Roland Haas, Erik Schnetter, Sebastiano Bernuzzi
topic: We have performed dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic (GR) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of NSM remnants including a nuclear equation of state (EOS) and neutrino effects.

Our simulations demonstrate that magnetars formed in NSMs are a viable engine for both sGRBs and kilonova
