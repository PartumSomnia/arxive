title: Detectability of Electromagnetic counterparts from Neutron Star mergers: prompt emission vs afterglow
authors: S Mohan, M Saleem, L Resmi
topic: We compare the detectability of prompt and afterglow emission from off-axis jets, assuming standard detector thresholds. We find that for top-hat jets, afterglow is a more potential counterpart than the prompt emission even with unfavorable afterglow parameters. For structured jets with a Gaussian profile, prompt emission is more promising than the afterglows at extreme viewing angles.

The extent to which spallation modifies the final NSM isotopic yields depends on: the ejected abundances, which are determined by the NSM astrophysical conditions and the properties of nuclei far from stability, the ejecta velocity distribution and propagation in interstellar matter, and the spallation cross-sections. Observed solar and stellar r-process yields could thus constrain the velocity distribution of ejected neutron star matter, assuming NSMs are the dominant r-process source

This relation results from a joint fit of data from observational evidence and from various numerical simulations. In this way, a large range of collapse times, physical effects and equation of states is covered. Finally, we apply the relation to the gravitational wave event GW170817 to constrain the equation of state of dense matter.

title: Towards a paradigm change in the main heavy r-process nucleosynthesis sites
authors: Aldana Grichener, Noam Soker 
topic: We study the basic properties of three possible r-process scenarios (sites) and compare them to recent observations and theoretical simulations. We find that the common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can account for the different observations of r-process nucleosynthesis, including the presence of r-process-rich low-metalicity stars in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The neutron star (NS)-NS merger scenario and the collapsar scenario encounter some difficulties. Despite that, we conclude that it is very likely that more than one r-process scenario exists, with a significant contribution by the CEJSN r-process scenario. We give a prescription to include this scenario in population synthesis studies of the r-process.
