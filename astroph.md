title: Studying the onset of deconfinement with multi-messenger astronomy of neutron stars
authors: David Blaschke, Mateusz Cierniak
topic: With the first multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star merger (GW170817) new constraints became available for masses and radii of neutron stars. We introduce a class of hybrid EoS that fulfils all these constraints and predicts a region in the mass-radius diagram that could be populated only by hybrid neutron stars with quark matter cores. A confirmation of this conjecture would be provided when the NICER radius measurement for the high-mass pulsar PSR J0740+6620 yields a radius less than 11 km. Would this radius measurement yield a result in excess of 12 km, this would allow for both, a purely hadronic and a hybrid nature of this star. In the latter case the maximum mass could reach 2.6 Msun so that the lighter object in the asymmetric binary merger GW190814 could have been a hybrid star. We demonstrate that this high mass can be compatible with an early onset of deconfinement at star masses below 1 Msun and the occurrence of low-mass twin stars. In such a case the remnant of GW170817 could be a long-lived hypermassive pulsar.

title: Testing the general theory of relativity using gravitational wave propagation from dark standard sirens
authors: Suvodip Mukherjee, Benjamin D. Wandelt, Joseph Silk
topic: Alternative theories of gravity predict modifications in the propagation of gravitational waves (GW) through space-time. One of the smoking-gun predictions of such theories is the change in the GW luminosity distance to GW sources as a function of redshift relative to the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance expected from EM probes. We propose a multi-messenger test of the theory of general relativity from the propagation of gravitational waves by combining EM and GW observations to resolve these issues from GW sources without EM counterparts (which are also referred to as dark standard sirens). By using the relation between the geometric distances accessible from baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and luminosity distance measurements from the GW sources, we can measure any deviation from the general theory of relativity via the GW sources of unknown redshift that will be detectable by networks of GW detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. Using this technique, the fiducial value of the frictional term can be measured to a precision 0=0.98+0.04−0.23 after marginalizing over redshift dependence, cosmological parameters, and GW bias parameters with 3500 dark standard sirens of masses 30msun each distributed up to redshift z=0.5. For a fixed redshift dependence, a value of 0=0.99+0.02−0.02 can be measured with a similar number of dark sirens. Application of our methodology to the far more numerous dark standard sirens detectable with next generation GW detectors, such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will allow achievement of higher accuracy than possible from use of bright standard sirens.

title: Non-linear diffusive shock acceleration: A recipe for injection of electrons
authors: Bojan Arbutina, Vladimir Zeković
topic: Prescriptions for electron injection into the diffusive shock acceleration process are required in many practical considerations of cosmic-ray astrophysics, particularly in modeling of the synchrotron emission of astrophysical sources. In particle-in-cell simulations of quasi-parallel magnetized collisionless shocks, we analyse the evolution of particle spectra. We find that in the later stages of shock evolution, the initially strong suprathermal part in the ion spectra fades, thus leaving the spectra composed of a Maxwellian and a power law. Once the electron and ion spectra flatten and become parallel, we find that the amounts of cosmic ray ions and electrons become similar. We make the step towards relating the micro and macro-scale physics by applying this injection rule to Blasi's semi-analytical model of non-linear diffusive shock acceleration, in order to obtain the particle spectra and electron-to-proton ratio Kep at high energies. By using shock jump conditions that include the electron heating, we find Kep as a function of Mach number. For Mach number 100, our model finely reproduces the typically observed ratio for Galactic cosmic-rays Kep 1:100 in the test particle regime.

title: Magnetically Ejected Disks: Equatorial Outflows Near Vertically Magnetized Black Hole
authors: Vladimir Karas, Kostas Sapountzis, Agnieszka Janiuk
topic: Black holes attract gaseous material from the surrounding environment. Cosmic plasma is largely ionized and magnetized because of electric currents flowing in the highly conductive environment near black holes; the process of accretion then carries the magnetic flux onto the event horizon, r=R+. On the other hand, magnetic pressure acts against accretion. It can not only arrest the inflow but it can even push the plasma away from the black hole if the magnetic repulsion prevails. The black hole does not hold the magnetic field by itself.
In this contribution we show an example of an equatorial outflow driven by a large scale magnetic field. We initiate our computations with a spherically symmetric distribution of gas, which flows onto the domain from a large distance, r\ggR+. After the flow settles in a steady (Bondi) solution, we impose an axially symmetric configuration of a uniform (Wald) magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis of the black hole. Then we evolve the initial configuration numerically by employing the MHD code that approaches the force-free limit of a perfectly conducting fluid.
We observe how the magnetic lines of force start accreting with the plasma while an equatorial intermittent outflow develops and goes on ejecting some material away from the black hole.

title: A low-mass binary neutron star: long-term ejecta evolution and kilonovae with weak blue emission
authors: Kyohei Kawaguchi, Sho Fujibayashi, Masaru Shibata, Masaomi Tanaka, Shinya Wanajo
topic: We study the long-term evolution of ejecta formed in a binary neutron star (BNS) merger that results in a long-lived remnant NS by performing a hydrodynamics simulation with the outflow data of a numerical relativity simulation as the initial condition. At the homologously expanding phase, the total ejecta mass reaches =0.1Msun with an average velocity of =0.1c and lanthanide fraction of 0.005. We further perform the radiative transfer simulation employing the obtained ejecta profile. We find that, contrary to a naive expectation from the large ejecta mass and low lanthanide fraction, the optical emission is not as bright as that in GW170817/AT2017gfo, while the infrared emission can be brighter. This light curve property is attributed to preferential diffusion of photons toward the equatorial direction due to the prolate ejecta morphology, large opacity contribution of Zr, Y, and lanthanides, and low specific heating rate of the ejecta. Our results suggest that these light curve features could be used as an indicator for the presence of a long-lived remnant NS. We also found that the bright optical emission broadly consistent with GW170817/AT2017gfo is realized for the case that the high-velocity ejecta components in the polar region are suppressed. These results suggest that the remnant in GW170817/AT2017gfo is unlikely to be a long-lived NS, but might have collapsed to a black hole within O(0.1) s.

title: A Unified Spectral Model for Accreting Neutron Stars
authors: Ayan Bhattacharjee, Sandip K. Chakrabarti
topic: Recent studies show that accretion flows around weakly magnetic Neutron Stars undergo multiple shocks, before reaching the surface of the star, which contribute to the spectral and timing variabilities observed in the X-Rays. Here, we report, for the first time, the spectral properties of a unified model of shocked accretion flows around Neutron Stars, based on the Two-Component Advective Flow paradigm. We compare our theoretical results with the X-Ray spectral features of Z and Atoll sources, across different states. We also fit RXTE/PCA spectra of Sco X-1 and 4U 1705-44 to show the potential application of this new model.

title: What role will binary neutron star merger afterglows play in multimessenger cosmology?
authors: S. Mastrogiovanni, R. Duque, E. Chassande-Mottin, F. Daigne, R.Mochkovitch
topic: Binary neutron star mergers offer a new and independent means of measuring the Hubble constant H0 by combining the gravitational-wave inferred source luminosity distance with its redshift obtained from electromagnetic follow-up. This method is limited by intrinsic degeneracy between the system distance and orbital inclination in the gravitational-wave signal. Observing the afterglow counterpart to a merger can further constrain the inclination angle, allowing this degeneracy to be partially lifted and improving the measurement of H0. In the case of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, afterglow light-curve and imagery modeling thus allowed to improve the H0 measurement by a factor of 3. However, systematic access to afterglow data is far from guaranteed. In fact, though each one allows a leap in H0 precision, these afterglow counterparts should prove rare in forthcoming multimessenger campaigns. We combine models for emission and detection of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic radiation from binary neutron star mergers with realistic population models and estimates for afterglow inclination angle constraints. Using these models, we quantify how fast H0 will be narrowed-down by successive multimessenger events with and without the afterglow. We find that, because of its rareness and though it greatly refines angle estimates, the afterglow counterpart should not significantly contribute to the measurement of H0 in the long run.

title: Testing Blandford-Znajek mechanism in black hole hyperaccretion flows for long-duration gamma-ray bursts
authors: Mei Du, Shuang-Xi Yi, Tong Liu, Cui-Ying Song, Wei Xie
topic: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally related to the core-collapse of massive stars. In the collapsar scenario, a rotating stellar-mass black hole (BH) surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk has been considered as one of the plausible candidates of GRB central engines. In this paper, we work on a sample including 146 long GRBs with significant jet break features in the multi-band afterglows. The jet opening angles can be then obtained by the jet break time. By asumming GRB jets powered by Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism in the BH hyperaccretion system, we analyze the distributions of the long GRB luminosities and durations in the samples, and constrain the accretion rates for the different BH spins. As the results, we find that the BZ mechanism is so powerful making it possible to interpret the long GRB prompt emissions within the reasonably accretion rates.

title: Updated universal relations for tidal deformabilities of neutron stars from phenomenological equations of state
authors: Daniel A. Godzieba, Rossella Gamba, David Radice, Sebastiano Bernuzzi
topic: Equation of state (EOS) insensitive relations, so-called universal relations, between the neutron star (NS) compactness, its multipolar tidal deformability coefficients, and between the tidal parameters for binary systems are essential to break degeneracies in gravitational wave data analysis. Here, we validate and recalibrate these universal relations using a large set of almost 2 million phenomenological EOSs that are consistent with current observations. In doing so, we extend universal relations to a larger region of the EOS parameter space, most notably to softer EOSs and larger compactnesses. We show that waveform models that neglect higher-than-leading-order tidal deformations of the NSs accumulate as much as 3.5 radians of dephasing from 20Hz to merger. We also perform a full Bayesian parameter estimation of the GW170817 data, and we compare the NS radius constraints produced using universal relations from the literature and the updated fits we propose here. We find that the new fits yield a NS radius that is smaller by about 500 meters. This difference is less than the statistical uncertainty on the radius at the signal-to-noise-ratio of GW170817, but it is significantly larger than the precision anticipated for next-generation detectors.

title: Effect of acceleration and escape of energetic particles on spectral steepening at shocks
authors: Federico Fraschetti
topic: Energetic particles spectra at interplanetary shocks often exhibit a power law within a narrow momentum range softening at higher energy. We introduce a transport equation accounting for particle acceleration and escape with diffusion contributed by self-generated turbulence close to the shock and by pre-existing turbulence far upstream. The upstream particle intensity steepens within one diffusion length from the shock as compared with diffusive shock acceleration rollover. The momentum spectrum, controlled by macroscopic parameters such as shock compression, speed, far upstream diffusion coefficient and escape time at the shock, can be reduced to a log-parabola and also to a broken power law. In the case of upstream uniform diffusion coefficient, the largely used power law/exponential cut off solution is retrieved.

title: Giant X-ray and optical Bump in GRBs: evidence for fall-back accretion model
authors: Litao Zhao, He Gao, WeiHua Lei, Lin Lan, Liangduan Liu
topic: The successful operation of dedicated detectors has brought us valuable information for understanding the central engine and the progenitor of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For instance, the giant X-ray and optical bumps found in some long-duration GRBs (e.g. GRBs 121027A and 111209A) imply that some extended central engine activities, such as the late X-ray flares, are likely due to the fall-back of progenitor envelope materials. Here we systemically search for long GRBs that consist of a giant X-ray or optical bump from the Swift GRB sample, and eventually we find 19 new possible candidates. The fall-back accretion model could well interpret the X-ray and optical bump for all candidates within a reasonable parameter space. Six candidates showing simultaneous bump signatures in both X-ray and optical observations, which could be well fitted at the same time when scaling down the X-ray flux into optical by one order of magnitude, are consistent with the standard synchrotron spectrum. The typical fall-back radius is distributed around 1010-1012 cm, which is consistent with the typical radius of a Wolf-Rayet star. The peak fall-back accretion rate is in the range of ~10-11-10-4Msun s−1 at time ~102-105 s, which is relatively easy to fulfill as long as the progenitor's metallicity is not too high. Combined with the sample we found, future studies of the mass supply rate for the progenitors with different mass, metallicity, and angular momentum distribution would help us to better constrain the progenitor properties of long GRBs.

title: Compact Dark Objects in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Andreas Bauswein, Gang Guo, Jr-Hua Lien, Yen-Hsun Lin, Meng-Ru Wu
topic: We estimate the long-lasting gravitational wave (GW) emission of compact dark objects following a binary neutron-star (NS) merger. We consider compact dark objects, which initially reside in the centers of NSs and which may consist of self-interacting dark matter (DM). By approximating the compact dark objects as test particles, we model the merging of NS binaries hosting DM components with three-dimensional relativistic simulations. Our simulation results suggest that the DM components remain gravitationally bound and orbit inside the merger remnant with orbital separations of typically a few km. The subsequent orbital motion of the DM components generates a GW signal with frequencies in the range of a few kHz. When considering a range of different binary masses and high-density equations of state (EoS), we find that the GW frequency of the orbiting DM components scales with the compactness of NSs. Similarly, we find relations between the DM GW frequency and the dominant postmerger GW frequency of the stellar fluid or the tidal deformability, which quantifies EoS effects during the binary inspiral. Hence, a measurement of these quantities can be used to specify the frequency range of the GW emission by DM. Under the assumption that GW back reaction is the only relevant dissipative process, the GW signal may last between seconds and years depending on the mass of the DM component. We estimate the detectability of the GW signals and find that DM components in NS mergers may only be detectable with existing and projected GW instruments if the dark objects are as massive as about 0.01 to 0.1 M_sun. We emphasize that the GW emission is limited by the lifetime of the remnant. A forming black hole will immediately swallow the DM objects because their orbits are smaller than the innermost stable circular orbit of the black hole.

title: An adaptive mesh, GPU-accelerated, and error minimized special relativistic hydrodynamics code
authors: Po-Hsun Tseng, Hsi-Yu Schive, Tzihong Chiueh
topic: We present a new special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) code capable of handling coexisting ultra-relativistically hot and non-relativistically cold gases. We achieve this by designing a new algorithm for conversion between primitive and conserved variables in the SRHD solver, which incorporates a realistic ideal-gas equation of state covering both the relativistic and non-relativistic regimes. The code can handle problems involving a Lorentz factor as high as 10to6 and optimally avoid the catastrophic cancellation. In addition, we have integrated this new SRHD solver into the code GAMER (this https URL) to support adaptive mesh refinement and hybrid OpenMP/MPI/GPU parallelization. It achieves a peak performance of 7-10to7 cell updates per second on a single Tesla P100 GPU and scales well to 2048 GPUs. We apply this code to two interesting astrophysical applications: (a) an asymmetric explosion source on the relativistic blast wave and (b) the flow acceleration and limb-brightening of relativistic jets.

title: The Mysterious Magnetospheres of Magnetars
authors: Matthew G. Baring, Zorawar Wadiasingh, Peter L. Gonthier, Alice K. Harding, Kun Hu
topic: Magnetars are the most luminous compact objects in the stellar mass range observed in the Milky Way, with giant flares of hard X-ray power ~10^45 erg/sec being detected from three soft gamma repeaters in the Galactic neighborhood. Periodicity seen in magnetar persistent emission, and a distinctive "spin-down" lengthening of this period, have driven the paradigm that strongly-magnetized neutron stars constitute these fascinating sources. The steady X-ray emission includes both thermal atmospheric components, and magnetospheric contributions that are manifested as hard X-ray "tails." This paper addresses observational and theoretical elements pertinent to the steady hard X-ray emission of magnetars, focusing on dissipative processes in their magnetospheres, and elements of Comptonization and polarization. It also discusses the action and possible signatures of the exotic and fundamental QED mechanisms of photon splitting and magnetic pair creation, and the quest for their observational vindication.

title: Three-dimensional modelling of accretion columns: spatial asymmetry and self-consistent simulations
authors: M. I. Gornostaev
topic: The paper presents the results of three-dimensional (3D) modelling of the structure and the emission of accretion columns formed above the surface of accreting strongly magnetized neutron stars under the circumstances when a pressure of the photons generated in the column base is enough to determine the dynamics of the plasma flow. On the foundation of numerical radiation hydrodynamic simulations, several 3D models of accretion column are constructed. The first group of the models contains spatially 3D columns. The corresponding calculations lead to the distributions of the radiation flux over the sidewalls of the columns which are not characterized by axial symmetry. The second group includes the self-consistent modelling of spectral radiative transfer and two-dimensional spatial structure of the column, with both thermal and bulk Comptonization taken into account. The changes in the structure of the column and the shape of X-ray continuum are investigated depending on physical parameters of the model.

title: Progress in Understanding the Enigmatic Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Shami Chatterjee
topic: In less than a decade, fast radio bursts have gone from a single debated curiosity to a diverse extragalactic population with established host galaxies and energy scales. While a wide range of models remain viable, the central engines of FRBs are likely to involve energetic young magnetars, as confirmed by the recent discovery of a Galactic analog to these extragalactic bursts. Here we provide a brief introductory review of fast radio bursts, focusing on the rapid recent progress in observations of these enigmatic events, our understanding of their central engines, and their use as probes of the intergalactic medium. We caution against a rush to judgement on the mechanisms and classification of all FRBs: at this point, it remains plausible that there could be one dominant central engine, as well as the possibility that radio bursts are a generic feature produced by many different mechanisms. We also emphasize the importance of improved modeling of our Galaxy and Galactic halo, which otherwise impose systematic errors on every FRB line of sight. The future of science with fast radio bursts appears bright.

title: Resonant Shattering Flares as Multimessenger Probes of the Nuclear Symmetry Energy
authors: Duncan Neill, William G. Newton, David Tsang
topic: The behaviour of the nuclear symmetry energy near saturation density is important for our understanding of dense nuclear matter. This density dependence can be parameterised by the nuclear symmetry energy and its derivatives evaluated at nuclear saturation density. In this work, we show that the core-crust interface mode of a neutron star is sensitive to these parameters, through the (density-weighted) shear-speed within the crust, which is in turn dependent on the symmetry energy profile of dense matter. We calculate the frequency at which the neutron star quadrupole (l=2) crust-core interface mode must be driven by the tidal field of its binary partner to trigger a Resonant Shattering Flare (RSF). We demonstrate that coincident multimessenger timing of a RSF and gravitational wave chirp from a neutron star merger would enable us to place strong constraints on the symmetry energy parameters, competitive with those from current nuclear experiments.

title: Broadband Modelling of Orphan Gamma Ray Flares
authors: S. R. Patel, D. Bose, N. Gupta, M. Zuberi
topic: Blazars, a class of highly variable active galactic nuclei, sometimes exhibit Orphan gamma-ray flares. These flares having high flux only in gamma-ray energies do not show significant variations in flux at lower energies. We study the temporal and spectral profile of these Orphan gamma-ray flares in detail from three gamma−ray bright blazars, 3C 273, PKS 1510-089 and 3C 279 and also their simultaneous broadband emissions. We find that the variability timescales of the Orphan gamma-ray flares were (0.96 pm 0.28) days, (3.12 pm 2.40) hr and (2.16 pm 0.72) hr, for 3C 273, PKS 1510-089 and 3C 279, respectively. The broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during these flares have been modelled with a leptonic model from two emission regions. This model suggests that Orphan gamma-ray flares might have originated from inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons by the seed photons from the broad-line region or dusty torus, which is the first region. While the second broader region, lying further down the jet, could be responsible for X-ray and radio emissions. The possible locations of these emission regions in the jets of the three sources have been estimated from SED modelling.

We discuss the involved equations, physical assumptions, and implemented numerical methods, along with a large battery of general relativistic tests performed with and without magnetic fields. Our tests demonstrate the correct implementation of the neutrino leakage scheme, paving the way for further improvements of our neutrino treatment and the first application to magnetized binary neutron star mergers. We also discuss the implementation in the Spritz code of high-order methods for a more accurate evolution of hydrodynamical quantities.

authors: Tuhin Malik, Sarmistha Banik, Debades Bandyopadhyay
topic: We compute a new equation of state table including Bose-Einstein condensate of K− mesons for core collapse supernova and neutron star merger simulations. Nuclei and interacting nucleons in non-uniform matter is described in an extended version of the nuclear statistical equilibrium model including excluded volume effects whereas the uniform matter at higher densities is treated in the relativistic hadron field theory with density dependent couplings. The equation of state table is generated for a wide range of density (10-12 to ~1 fm-3), positive charge fraction (0.01 to 0.60) and temperature (0.1 to 158.48 MeV). The impact of antikaon condensate is investigated on different thermodynamic quantities for example free energy per baryon, entropy per baryon, pressure as well as compositions of matter. Furthermore, critical temperatures of antikaon condensation and the phase diagram of matter are also studied in this article.

title: 2D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of supernova ejecta with a central power source
authors: Akihiro Suzuki, Keiichi Maeda
topic: We present the results of two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of expanding supernova ejecta with a central energy source. As suggested in previous multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, a sufficiently powerful central energy source can blow away the expanding supernova ejecta, leading to efficient mixing of stratified layers in the ejecta. We assume that the energy injection is realized in the form of non-thermal radiation from the wind nebula embedded at the center of the ejecta. We found that the multi-dimensional mixing in the ejecta assists the injected non-thermal radiation escaping from the ejecta. When the non-thermal radiation is absorbed by the ejecta, it is converted into bright thermal radiation or is consumed as the kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta. We found that central energy sources with the injection timescale similar to the photon diffusion timescale realize an efficient conversion of the injected energy into thermal radiation. On the other hand, a rapid energy injection ends up accelerating the ejecta rather than giving rise to bright thermal emission. This remarkable difference potentially explains the diversity of energetic supernovae including broad-lined Ic and superluminous supernovae.

title: GRB 180418A: A possibly-short GRB with a wide-angle outflow in a faint host galaxy
authors: Alicia Rouco Escorial, Wen-fai Fong, Peter Veres, Tanmoy Laskar et al
topic: We present X-ray and multi-band optical observations of the afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 180418A, discovered by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. We present a reanalysis of the GBM and BAT data deriving durations of the prompt emission of T90~2.56s and ~1.90s, respectively. Modeling the Fermi/GBM catalog of 1405 bursts (2008-2014) in the Hardness-T90 plane, we obtain a probability of ~60% that GRB 180418A is a short-hard burst. From a combination of Swift/XRT and Chandra observations, the X-ray afterglow is detected to ~38.5 days after the burst, and exhibits a single power-law decline with FX proportional to t^-0.98. Late-time Gemini observations reveal a faint r ~24.95 mag host galaxy at an angular offset of ~0.16''. At the likely redshift range of z ~1-1.5, we find that the X-ray afterglow luminosity of GRB 180418A is intermediate between short and long GRBs at all epochs during which there is contemporaneous data, and that GRB 180418A lies closer to the E({\gamma},peak)-E({\gamma},iso) correlation for short GRBs. Modeling the multi-wavelength afterglow with the standard synchrotron model, we derive the burst explosion properties and find a jet opening angle of {\theta}j =>9-14 degrees. If GRB 180418A is a short GRB that originated from a neutron star merger, it has one of the brightest and longest-lived afterglows along with an extremely faint host galaxy. If instead the event is a long GRB that originated from a massive star collapse, it has among the lowest luminosity afterglows, and lies in a peculiar space in terms of the Hardness-T90 and E({\gamma},peak)-E_({\gamma},iso) planes.

title: Dynamical Formation Scenarios for GW190521 and Prospects for Decihertz Gravitational-Wave Astronomy with GW190521-Like Binaries
authors: A. Miguel Holgado, Alexis Ortega, Carl L. Rodriguez
topic: The gravitational-wave (GW) detection of GW190521 has provided new insights on the mass distribution of black holes and new constraints for astrophysical formation channels. With independent claims of GW190521 having significant pre-merger eccentricity, we investigate what this implies for GW190521-like binaries that form dynamically. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will also be sensitive to GW190521-like binaries if they are circular from an isolated formation channel. We show, however, that GW190521-like binaries that form dynamically may skip the LISA band entirely. To this end, we simulate GW190521 analogues that dynamically form via post-Newtonian binary-single scattering. From these scattering experiments, we find that GW190521-like binaries may enter the LIGO-Virgo band with significant eccentricity as suggested by recent studies, though well below an eccentricity of e10Hz less 0.7. Eccentric GW190521-like binaries further motivate the astrophysical science case for a decihertz GW observatory, such as the kilometer-scale version of the Midband Atomic Gravitational-wave Interferometric Sensor (MAGIS). Pre-merger observations of GW190521-like binaries with such a decihertz GW detector would be able to constrain the eccentricity of GW190521-like binaries to greater precision than with just LIGO-Virgo alone. These eccentricity constraints would also provide additional insights into the possible environments that GW190521-like binaries form in.

title: Dynamical tides in neutron stars: The impact of the crust
authors: Andrea Passamonti, Nils Andersson, Pantelis Pnigouras
topic: We consider the dynamical tidal response of a neutron star in an inspiralling binary, focussing on the impact of the star's elastic crust. Within the context of Newtonian gravity, we add the elastic aspects to the theoretical formulation of the problem and quantify the dynamical excitation of different classes of oscillation modes. The results demonstrate the expectation that the fundamental mode dominates the tidal response and show how the usual tidal deformability (and the Love number) emerge in the static limit. In addition, we consider to what extent the different modes may be excited to a level where the breaking strain of the crust would be exceeded (locally). The results show that the fundamental mode may fracture the crust during the late stages of inspiral. This is also the case for the first gravity mode, which reaches the breaking threshold in strongly stratified stars.

topic: The recently discovered rapid transient GN-z11-flash has been suggested to be the prompt-emission ultraviolet flash associated with a gamma-ray burst serendipitously exploding in the ultra-high-z galaxy GN-z11. We here place the flash into the context of the early ultraviolet emission of gamma-ray bursts, and find it is in agreement with the luminosity distribution of these events.

title: Probing the nuclear equation of state from the existence of a ~2.6 Msun neutron star: the GW190814 puzzle
authors: A. Kanakis-Pegios, P.S. Koliogiannis, Ch.C. Moustakidis
topic: On August 14, 2019, the LIGO/Virgo collaboration observed a compact object with mass ~2.59+0.08−0.09 Msun, as a component of a system where the main companion was a black hole with mass ~23 Msun. A scientific debate initiated concerning the identification of the low mass component, as it falls into the neutron star - black hole mass gap. The understanding of the nature of GW190814 event will offer rich information concerning open issues, the speed of sound and the possible phase transition into other degrees of freedom. In the present work, we made an effort to probe the nuclear equation of state along with the GW190814 event. Firstly, we examine possible constraints on the nuclear equation of state inferred from the consideration that the low mass companion is a slow or rapidly rotating neutron star. In this case, the role of the upper bounds on the speed of sound is revealed, in connection with the dense nuclear matter properties. Secondly, we systematically study the tidal deformability of a possible high mass candidate existing as an individual star or as a component one in a binary neutron star system. As the tidal deformability and radius are quantities very sensitive on the neutron star equation of state, they are excellent counters on dense matter properties. We conjecture that similar isolated neutron stars or systems may exist in the Universe and their possible future observation will shed light on the maximum neutron star mass problem.

title: The Effect of Jet-Ejecta Interaction on the Viewing Angle Dependence of Kilonova Light Curves
authors: Hannah Klion, Paul C. Duffell, Daniel Kasen, Eliot Quataert
topic: The merger of two neutron stars produces an outflow of radioactive heavy nuclei. Within a second of merger, the central remnant is expected to also launch a relativistic jet, which shock-heats and disrupts a portion of the radioactive ejecta. Within a few hours, emission from the radioactive material gives rise to an ultraviolet, optical, and infrared transient (a kilonova). We use the endstates of a suite of 2D relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of jet-ejecta interaction as initial conditions for multi-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations of the resulting viewing angle-dependent light curves and spectra starting at 1.5h after merger. We find that on this timescale, jet shock heating does not affect the kilonova emission. However, the jet disruption to the density structure of the ejecta does change the light curves. The jet carves a channel into the otherwise spheroidal ejecta, revealing the hot, inner regions. As seen from near (less30deg) the jet axis, the kilonova is brighter by a factor of a few and bluer. The strength of this effect depends on the jet parameters, since the light curves of more heavily disrupted ejecta are more strongly affected. The light curves and spectra are also more heavily modified in the ultraviolet than in the optical.

title: External Inverse-Compton Emission Associated with Extended and Plateau Emission of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts: Application to GRB 160821B
authors: B. Theodore Zhang, Kohta Murase, Chengchao Yuan, Shigeo S. Kimura, Peter Mészáros
topic: The recent detection of TeV photons from two gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), GRB 190114C and GRB 180720B, has opened a new window for multi-messenger and multi-wavelength astrophysics of high-energy transients. We study the origin of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays from the short GRB 160821B, for which the MAGIC Collaboration reported a ~3σ statistical significance. Short GRBs are often accompanied by extended and plateau emission, which is attributed to internal dissipation resulting from activities of a long-lasting central engine, and Murase et al. (2018) recently suggested the external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario for VHE counterparts of short GRBs and neutron star mergers. Applying this scenario to GRB 160821B, we show that the EIC flux can reach ~10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 within a time period of ~103−104 s, which is consistent with the MAGIC observations. EIC gamma-rays expected during the extended and plateau emission will be detectable with greater significance by future detectors such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The resulting light curve has a distinguishable feature, where the VHE emission is predicted to reach the peak around the end of the seed photons.

title: GRBs from neutrino pair annihilation in the presence of quintessence surrounding a black hole
authors: G. Lambiase, L. Mastrototaro
topic: Quintessence fields, introduced to explain the speed-up of the Universe, might affect the geometry of spacetime surrounding black holes, as compared to the standard Schwarzschild and Kerr geometries. In this framework, we study the neutrino pairs annihilation into electron-positron pairs (nunu- to e-e+) near the surface of a neutron star, focusing, in particular, on the Schwarzschild-like geometry in presence of quintessence fields. The effect of the latter is to increase the minimum photon-sphere radius (Rph), increasing in such a way the maximum energy deposition rate near to Rph. The rate turns out to be several orders of magnitude greater than the rate computed in the framework of General Relativity. These results might provide an efficient mechanism for the generation of GRBs and lead to constraints on the parameters of the quintessence model.

authors: Arianna Ligorini, Jacek Niemiec, Oleh Kobzar, Masanori Iwamoto, Artem Bohdan, Martin Pohl, Yosuke Matsumoto, Takanobu Amano, Shuichi Matsukiyo, Yodai Esaki, Masahiro Hoshino
topic: Mildly relativistic shocks in magnetized electron-ion plasmas are investigated with 2D kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of unprecedentedly high resolution and large scale for conditions that may be found at internal shocks in blazar cores. Ion-scale effects cause corrugations along the shock surface whose properties somewhat depend on the configuration of the mean perpendicular magnetic field, that is either in or out of the simulation plane. We show that the synchrotron maser instability persists to operate in mildly relativistic shocks in agreement with theoretical predictions and produces coherent emission of upstream-propagating electromagnetic waves. Shock front ripples are excited in both mean-field configurations and they engender effective wave amplification. The interaction of these waves with upstream plasma generates electrostatic wakefields.

title: Simulations of radiation driven winds from Keplerian discs
authors: Sananda Raichaidhuri, Mukesh K. Vyas, Indranil Chattopadhyay
topic: We study the ejection of winds from thin accretion discs around stellar mass black holes and the time evolution of these winds in presence of radiation field generated by the accretion disc. Winds are produced by radiation, thermal pressure and the centrifugal force of the disc. The winds are found to be mildly relativistic, with speeds reaching up to terminal speeds 0.1 for accretion rate 4 in Eddington units. We show that the ejected matter gets its rotation by transporting angular momentum from the disc to the wind. We also show that the radiation drag affects the accretion disc winds in a very significant manner. Not only that the terminal speeds are reduced by an order of magnitude due to radiation drag, but we also show that the non-linear effect of radiation drag, can mitigate the formation of the winds from the matter ejected by the accretion disc. As radiation drag reduces the velocity of the wind, the mass outflow rate is reduced in its presence as well.

title: Gravitational-wave asteroseismology with f-modes from neutron star binaries at the merger phase
authors: Harry Ho-Yin Ng, Patrick Chi-Kit Cheong, Lap-Ming Lin, Tjonnie Guang Feng Li
topic: Gravitational-wave signals from coalescing binary neutron stars can yield important information about the properties of nuclear-matter equation of state from the early part of the signal through tidal effects to the properties and oscillation frequencies of the merger product. We investigate a direct link between the properties of isolated neutron stars and their merger, by comparing the frequency of the fundamental oscillation mode (f-mode) of neutron stars with the gravitational-wave frequency associated with the merger of two neutron stars. We calculate the quadrupolar (l=2) f-mode oscillation (f2f) of non-rotating and rotating neutron stars using a nonlinear hydrodynamics code in the conformally-flat approximation and obtain the gravitational-wave frequency associated with the peak amplitude (fmax) of binary-neutron stars from a set of publicly available simulations. We find that fmax and f2f differ by about 1\%, on average, across forty-five equal-mass systems with different total mass and equations of state. Assuming that the gravitational-wave frequency is still approximately equal to twice the orbital frequency Omega near the merger, the result indicates that the condition for tidal resonance |m|Omega=f2f is satisfied to high accuracy near the merger, where m=2 is the azimuthal quantum number. Moreover, the well established universal relation between fmax and the tidal deformability of equal-mass binary systems can now be explained by a similar relation between f2f and the tidal deformability of isolated neutron stars, which has been demonstrated to be associated with the nearly incompressible properties of neutron stars. Our findings suggest that it is possible to relate the gravitational-wave signal at the merger of a binary neutron star system directly to the fundamental oscillation modes and the mass ratio.

title: The evolution of binary neutron star post-merger remnants: a review
authors: Nikhil Sarin, Paul D. Lasky
topic: Two neutron stars merge somewhere in the Universe approximately every 10 seconds, creating violent explosions observable in gravitational waves and across the electromagnetic spectrum. The transformative coincident gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 gave invaluable insights into these cataclysmic collisions, probing bulk nuclear matter at supranuclear densities, the jet structure of gamma-ray bursts, the speed of gravity, and the cosmological evolution of the local Universe, among other things. Despite the wealth of information, it is still unclear when the remnant of GW170817 collapsed to form a black hole. Evidence from other short gamma-ray bursts indicates a large fraction of mergers may form long-lived neutron stars. We review what is known observationally and theoretically about binary neutron star post-merger remnants. From a theoretical perspective, we review our understanding of the evolution of short- and long-lived merger remnants, including fluid, magnetic-field, and temperature evolution. These considerations impact prospects of detection of gravitational waves from either short- or long-lived neutron star remnants which potentially allows for new probes into the hot nuclear equation of state in conditions inaccessible in terrestrial experiments. We also review prospects for determining post-merger physics from current and future electromagnetic observations, including kilonovae and late-time x-ray and radio afterglow observations.

title: External Inverse-Compton Emission from Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts: Application to GRB 190829A
authors: B. Theodore Zhang, Kohta Murase, Péter Veres, Péter Mészáros
topic: The detection of TeV gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) brought new opportunities to study the physics of particle acceleration at relativistic shocks. The H.E.S.S. telescopes recently observed very-high-energy (VHE) emission from a nearby low-luminosity GRB, GRB 190829A. Follow-up observations with, e.g., Swift-XRT, revealed unusual flare activities at ~103 s, which can be caused by a long-lasting central engine. We show that the VHE emission during the H.E.S.S. observation time is naturally produced in the external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario, where seed photons supplied by the flares or other late-time dissipation are upscattered to VHE energies by the non-thermal electrons accelerated at the external forward shock. Our calculations show that the EIC flare nearly coincides with the late-prompt flare, but extends ~3−4 times longer than the duration of the late-prompt flare. The preferred kinetic energy and initial Lorentz factor used in our model are ~1052 erg and ~20, respectively. Understanding the mechanisms of the VHE emission from low-luminosity GRBs will help us constrain the properties of the outflow and the central engine activities, as well as the particle acceleration mechanism.

title: Off-centred force-free neutron star magnetospheres
authors: Jérôme Pétri
topic: Neutron star electromagnetic activity produces pairs that fill their magnetosphere represented to the zeroth order by the force-free approximation. Neither dissipation nor acceleration nor radiation from charged particles is expected from this simplified model. So far, only centred dipole magnetic fields have been studied in this limit. In this paper, we explore the consequences of a rotating off-centred dipole on the force-free magnetosphere, showing the new magnetic field geometry, its spin-down luminosity as well as the electromagnetic kick and torque felt by the neutron star. Solutions are obtained by time-dependent numerical simulations of the force-free regime using our pseudo-spectral code written in spherical coordinates. Our results are also compared to known analytical expressions found for the off-centred vacuum dipole by an expansion to lowest order in the parameter eps=d/R, where d is the displacement of the dipole from the stellar centre and R the neutron star radius. The presence of a force-free plasma enhances the spin-down luminosity as well as the electromagnetic kick and torque with respect to a centred force-free dipole. The impact on isolated and binary neutron stars is revised in light of these new results.

title: MAGIC observations of the nearby short gamma-ray burst GRB 160821B
authors: MAGIC Collaboration
topic: The coincident detection of GW170817 in gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation spanning the radio to MeV gamma-ray bands provided the first direct evidence that short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can originate from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. On the other hand, the properties of short GRBs in high-energy gamma rays are still poorly constrained, with only ~20 events detected in the GeV band, and none in the TeV band. GRB~160821B is one of the nearest short GRBs known at z=0.162. Recent analyses of the multiwavelength observational data of its afterglow emission revealed an optical-infrared kilonova component, characteristic of heavy-element nucleosynthesis in a BNS merger. Aiming to better clarify the nature of short GRBs, this burst was automatically followed up with the MAGIC telescopes, starting from 24 seconds after the burst trigger. Evidence of a gamma-ray signal is found above ~0.5 TeV at a significance of ~3σ during observations that lasted until 4 hours after the burst. Assuming that the observed excess events correspond to gamma-ray emission from GRB 160821B, in conjunction with data at other wavelengths, we investigate its origin in the framework of GRB afterglow models. The simplest interpretation with one-zone models of synchrotron-self-Compton emission from the external forward shock has difficulty accounting for the putative TeV flux. Alternative scenarios are discussed where the TeV emission can be relatively enhanced. The role of future GeV-TeV observations of short GRBs in advancing our understanding of BNS mergers and related topics is briefly addressed.

title: Determination of Solar System R-Process Abundances using ENDF/B-VIII.0 and TENDL-2015 libraries
authors: Boris Pritychenko
topic: Recent multi-messenger detection of the binary neutron star merger (GW170817) energized the astrophysical community and encouraged further research for determination of nuclear physics observables. Comprehensive studies of atomic nuclei in the cosmos provide an opportunity for investigating these astrophysical phenomena and acquiring complementary information on stellar nucleosynthesis processes that can be verified using the latest nuclear data.
Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF) libraries contain complete collections of reaction cross sections over the energy range relevant to astrophysics, fission yields and decay data. These data collections have been used worldwide in nuclear science, industry and national security applications. There is great interest in exploring the ENDF/B-VIII.0 and TALYS Evaluated Nuclear Data Library (TENDL-2015) for nuclear astrophysics purposes and comparing findings with the Karlsruhe Astrophysical Database of Nucleosynthesis in Stars (KADoNiS).
The Maxwellian-averaged cross sections (MACS) and astrophysical reaction rates have been calculated using the ENDF/B-VIII.0 and TENDL-2015 evaluated data sets. The calculated cross sections were combined with the solar system abundances and fitted using the classical model of stellar nucleosynthesis. Astrophysical rapid- and slow-neutron capture, r- and s-process, respectively, abundances were obtained from present data and compared with available values. Further analysis of MACS reveals potential evaluated libraries data deficiencies and a strong need for new measurements. The current results demonstrate a large nuclear astrophysics potential of evaluated libraries and mutually beneficial relations between nuclear industry and research efforts.

topic: Gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) observations of neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers can provide precise local measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), ideal for resolving the current H0 tension. We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated NSBHs, incorporating both GW and EM selection for the first time. We show that NSBHs could achieve unbiased 1.5-2.4% precision H0 estimates by 2030. The achievable precision is strongly affected by the details of spin precession and tidal disruption, highlighting the need for improved modeling of NSBH mergers.

title: Spectral and polarization properties of black hole accretion disc emission: including absorption effects
authors: Roberto Taverna, Lorenzo Marra, Stefano Bianchi, Mičhal Dovciak, René Goosmann, Frederic Marin, Giorgio Matt, Wenda Zhang
topic: The study of radiation emitted from black hole accretion discs represents a crucial way to understand the main physical properties of these sources, and in particular the black hole spin. Beside spectral analysis, polarimetry is becoming more and more important, motivated by the development of new techniques which will soon allow to perform measurements also in the X- and {\gamma}-rays. Photons emitted from black hole accretion discs in the soft state are indeed expected to be polarized, with an energy dependence which can provide an estimate of the black hole spin. Calculations performed so far, however, considered scattering as the only process to determine the polarization state of the emitted radiation, implicitly assuming that the temperatures involved are such that material in the disc is entirely ionized. In this work we generalize the problem by calculating the ionization structure of a surface layer of the disc with the public code CLOUDY , and then by determining the polarization properties of the emerging radiation using the Monte Carlo code STOKES . This allows us to account for absorption effects alongside scattering ones. We show that including absorption can deeply modify the polarization properties of the emerging radiation with respect to what is obtained in the pure-scattering limit. As a general rule, we find that the polarization degree is larger when absorption is more important, which occurs e.g. for low accretion rates and/or spins when the ionization of the matter in the innermost accretion disc regions is far from complete.

title: Radio timing in a millisecond pulsar-extreme/intermediate mass ratio binary system
authors: Tom Kimpson, Kinwah Wu, Silvia Zane
topic: Radio timing observations of a millisecond pulsar in orbit around the Galactic centre black hole (BH) or a BH at the centre of globular clusters could answer foundational questions in astrophysics and fundamental physics. Pulsar radio astronomy typically employs the post-Keplerian approximation to determine the system parameters. However, in the strong gravitational field around the central BH, higher order relativistic effects may become important. We compare the pulsar timing delays given by the post-Keplerian approximation with those given by a relativistic timing model. We find significant discrepancies between the solutions derived for the Einstein delay and the propagation delay (i.e. Roemer and Sharpiro delay) compared to the fully relativistic solutions. Correcting for these higher order relativistic effects is essential in order to construct accurate radio timing models for pulsar systems at the Galactic centre and the centre of globular clusters and informing issues related to their detection.

title: Kinetic model of large-amplitude oscillations in neutron star pair cascades
authors: Fábio Cruz, Thomas Grismayer, Luis O. Silva
topic: Electron-positron pair cascades developed in the extreme electromagnetic fields of neutron star polar caps are considered a key source of magnetospheric plasma in these objects. We use a simplified model that maps the Quantum Electrodynamics processes governing the pair cascades to analytically and numerically model the development of the pair cascade, and show that large-amplitude oscillations of the electric field are inductively driven by the resulting plasma. A plasma instability arises in these oscillations, and particles accelerated in growing electric field perturbations can drive secondary pair bursts that damp the large-amplitude oscillations. An analytical model is proposed to describe this interplay between the pair production and kinetic collective plasma processes. All analytical results are shown to be in excellent agreement with particle-in-cell simulations.

title: First Multimessenger Observations of a Neutron Star Merger
authors: Raffaella Margutti, Ryan Chornock
topic: We describe the first observations of the same celestial object with gravitational waves and light.
GW170817 was the first detection of a neutron star merger with gravitational waves. The detection of a spatially coincident weak burst of gamma-rays (GRB 170817A) 1.7 s after the merger constituted the first electromagnetic detection of a gravitational wave source and established a connection between at least some cosmic short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and binary neutron star mergers. A fast-evolving optical and near-infrared transient (AT 2017gfo) associated with the event can be interpreted as resulting from the ejection of ~0.05 Msun of material enriched in r-process elements, finally establishing binary neutron star mergers as at least one source of r-process nucleosynthesis. Radio and X-ray observations revealed a long-rising source that peaked ~160 d after the merger. Combined with the apparent superluminal motion of the associated VLBI source, these observations show that the merger produced a relativistic structured jet whose core was oriented =20 deg from the line of sight and with properties similar to SGRBs. The jet structure likely results from the jet interaction with the merger ejecta. The electromagnetic and gravitational wave information can be combined to produce constraints on the expansion rate of the universe and the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. These multimessenger endeavors will be a major emphasis for future work.

authors: Barun Maity, Poonam Chandra
topic: We report the lowest frequency measurements of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 171205A with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) covering a frequency range from 250--1450 MHz and a period of days. It is the first GRB afterglow detected at 250--500 MHz frequency range and the second brightest GRB detected with the uGMRT. Even though the GRB is observed for nearly 1000 days, there is no evidence of transition to non-relativistic regime. We also analyse the archival  X-ray data. We also find no evidence of a jet break from the analysis of combined data. We fit synchrotron afterglow emission arising from a relativistic, isotropic, self-similar deceleration as well as from a shock-breakout of wide-angle cocoon. Our data also allow us to discern the nature and the density of the circumburst medium. We find that the density profile deviates from a standard constant density medium and suggests that the GRB exploded in a stratified wind like medium. Our analysis shows that the lowest frequency measurements covering the absorbed part of the light curves are critical to unravel the GRB environment. Our data combined with other published measurements indicate that the radio afterglow has contribution from two components: a weak, possibly slightly off-axis jet and a surrounding wider cocoon, consistent with the results of Izzo et al. (2019). The cocoon emission likely dominates at early epochs, whereas the jet starts to dominate at later epochs, resulting in flatter radio lightcurves.

title: Improved near optimal angular quadratures for polarised radiative transfer in 3D MHD models
authors: Jaume Jaume Bestard, Jiří Štěpán, Javier Trujillo Bueno
topic: Accurate angular quadratures are crucial for the numerical solution of three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer problems, especially when the spectral line polarisation produced by the scattering of anisotropic radiation is included. There are two requirements for obtaining an optimal quadrature and they are difficult to satisfy simultaneously: high accuracy and short computing time. By imposing certain symmetries, we were recently able to derive a set of near optimal angular quadratures. Here, we extend our previous investigation by considering other symmetries. Moreover, we test the performance of our new quadratures by numerically solving a radiative transfer problem of resonance line polarisation in a 3D model of the solar atmosphere resulting from a magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. The new angular quadratures derived here outperform the previous ones in terms of the number of rays needed to achieve any given accuracy.

topic: GW190426 was recently reported as one of the 39 candidate gravitational wave (GW) events in, which has an unusual source-frame chirp mass and may be the first GW signal from a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger. Assuming an astrophysical origin, we reanalyze GW190426 using several waveforms with different characteristics, and consider two different priors for the mass ratio of the binary (Uniform and LogUniform). We find that the results are influenced by the priors of mass ratio, and this candidate could also be from the merger of two low mass black holes (BH). In the case for a binary black hole (BBH) merger, the effective spin is likely negative and the effective precession spin is non-negligible. As for the NSBH merger, supposing the mass of the light object follow the distribution of current neutron stars (NSs) with a reasonably measured/constrained mass, the spin of the low mass BH is so small that is hard to generate bright electromagnetic emission. Finally, we estimate a merger rate of GW190426-like systems to be

title: Maximum mass of hybrid star formed via shock induced phase transition in cold neutron stars
authors: Ritam Mallick, Shailendra Singh, Rana Nandi
topic: This article studies the maximum mass limit of the quark star formed after the shock-induced phase transition of a cold neutron star. By employing hadronic and quark equation of state that satisfies the current mass bound, we use combustion adiabat conditions to find such a limit. The combustion adiabat condition results in a local or a global maximum pressure at an intermediate density range. The maximum pressure corresponds to a local or global maximum mass for the phase transformed hybrid star. The phase transition is usually exothermic if we have a local maximum mass. The criteria for exothermic or endothermic phase transition depend on whether the quark pressure/energy ratios to nuclear pressure/energy are smaller or greater than 1. We find that exothermic phase transition in a cold neutron star usually results in hybrid stars whose mass is smaller than a parent neutron star. The phase transition is endothermic for a global maximum pressure; thereby, one gets a global maximum mass. Hybrid stars much massive than phase transformed local maximum mass can be formed, provided there is some external energy source during the phase transition process. However, for some cases, even massive hybrid stars can form with exothermic phase transition for EoSs having global maximum pressure.

title: Properties of Rotating Neutron Star in Density-dependent Relativistic Mean-field Models
authors: Rashid Riahi, Seyed Zafarollah Kalantari
topic: Equilibrium sequences were developed for rotating NS in the relativistic mean-field interaction framework using four density-dependent equations of state for the NS matter. These sequences were constructed for the observed rotation frequencies of 25, 317, 346, 716, and 1122 Hz. The bounds of sequences were calculated in each model to determine the stability region. The gravitational mass, quadrupole moment, polar, forward and backward redshifts, and Kerr parameter were calculated. DDF and DD-MEdelta were unable to properly describe the low-frequency neutron stars, PSR J0348+432, PSR J1614-2230 , and PSR J0740+6620 rotate at a frequency of 25, 317, and 346 Hz, respectively. All the selected EOSs properly described the rotation of PSR J1748-244ad, and PSR J1739-285 at a frequency of 716 and 1122 Hz, respectively. The mass of these stars was in the range of [0.68, 2.14]Msun and [1.67, 2.24]Msun, respectively. The polar, forward and backward redshifts, and the quadrupole moment were calculated in all selected rotating frequencies and the Keplerian sequence. The results were consistent with observations. Confirming the mass of 1.5+0.4−1.0Msun for EXO 0748-676, our result will be close to the observed value, and the EOSs used in this study properly describe this star. The extremum of Kerr parameter, polar, forward and backward redshifts in all models reached constant values of, a/M= 0.7, Zp= 0.8, Zfeq= -0.3 and Zbeq= 2.2. These behaviors of redshifts and Kerr parameter are approximately independent of EOS. The observed behaviors must evaluate by other EOSs to find universal relations for these quantities. Also, a limit value was found for each of these parameters. In this case where these parameters are greater than the limit value, the star can rotate at a frequency equal to or greater than ν= 1122 Hz.

title: Radiative turbulent flares in magnetically-dominated plasmas
authors: J. Nättilä, A. M. Beloborodov
topic: We perform 2D and 3D kinetic simulations of reconnection-mediated turbulent flares in a magnetized electron-positron plasma, with weak and strong radiative cooling. Such flares can be generated around neutron stars and accreting black holes. We focus on the magnetically-dominated regime where tension of the background magnetic field lines exceeds the plasma rest mass by a factor 1. In the simulations, turbulence is excited on a macroscopic scale l0, and we observe that it develops by forming thin, dynamic current sheets on various scales. The deposited macroscopic energy dissipates by energizing thermal and nonthermal particles. The particle energy distribution is shaped by impulsive acceleration in reconnecting current sheets, gradual stochastic acceleration, and radiative losses. We parameterize radiative cooling by the ratio A of light-crossing time l0/c to a cooling timescale, and study the effect of increasing A on the flare. When radiative losses are sufficiently weak, Aless10-10, the produced emission is dominated by stochastically accelerated particles, and the radiative power depends logarithmically on A. The resulting flare radiation spectrum is broad and anisotropic. In the strong-cooling regime, Agreater 10-10, stochastic acceleration is suppressed while impulsive acceleration in the current sheets continues to operate. As A increases further, the emission becomes dominated by thermal particles. Our simulations offer a new tool to study particle acceleration by turbulence, especially at high energies, where cooling competes with acceleration. We find that the particle distribution is influenced by strong intermittency of dissipation, and stochastic acceleration cannot be described by a universal diffusion coefficient.

title: Years Delayed Gamma-ray and Radio Afterglows Originated from TDE Wind-Torus Interactions
authors: Guobin Mou, Wei Wang
topic: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) that occur in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with dusty tori are a special class of sources. TDEs can generate ultrafast and large opening-angle winds, which will almost inevitably collide with the preexisting AGN dusty tori a few years later after the TDE outburst. The wind-torus interactions will drive two kinds of shocks: the bow shocks at the windward side of the torus clouds, and the cloud shocks inside the torus clouds. In a previous work, we proved that the shocked clouds will give rise to considerable X-ray emissions. In this work, we focus on the radiations of high energy particles accelerated at both shocks. Benefitting from the strong radiation field at the inner edge of the torus, the inverse Compton scattering of AGN photons by relativistic electrons at bow shocks dominates the overall gamma-ray radiation. Our scenario provides a prediction of the years delayed afterglows in radio/X-ray/gamma-ray band for TDE and reveals their connections, Moreover, it suggests a novel method for exploring the clouds around the central black hole and the power of TDE winds.

title: Fast ejecta as a potential way to distinguish black holes from neutron stars in high-mass gravitational-wave events
authors: Elias R. Most, L. Jens Papenfort, Samuel Tootle, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: High-mass gravitational-wave events in the neutron-star mass range, such as GW190425, have recently started to be detected by the LIGO/Virgo detectors. If the masses of the two binary components fall in the neutron-star mass range, such a system is typically classified as a binary neutron-star system, although the detected gravitational-wave signal may be too noisy to clearly establish a neutron-star nature of the high-mass component in the binary and rule out a black hole--neutron star system for such an event. We here show that high-mass binary neutron-star mergers with a very massive neutron-star primary close to the maximum-mass limit, m1 greater 2.2Msun, produce fast dynamical mass ejecta from the spin-up of the primary star at merger. By simulating the merger of black hole--neutron star systems of exactly the same masses and spins, we show that these fast ejecta are entirely absent, if the primary is instead a black hole. In addition, we find that both systems leave almost identical amounts of baryon mass behind, which is not immediately accreted by the black hole. This implies that both systems will likely have comparable electromagnetic afterglow emission stemming from the remnant disk. Hence, fast ejecta at merger have the potentialto distinguish neutron stars from black holes in high-mass mergers, although these ejecta may be challenging to detect observationally.

title: Microscopic equation of state of hot nuclear matter for numerical relativity simulations
authors: Domenico Logoteta, Albino Perego, Ignazio Bombaci
topic: A precise understanding of the equation of state (EOS) of dense and hot matter is key to modeling relativistic astrophysical environments, including core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), protoneutron star (PNSs) evolution, and compact binary mergers. In this paper, we extend the microscopic zero-temperature BL (Bombaci and Logoteta) derived by Bombaci and Logoteta to finite temperature and arbitrary nuclear composition. We employ this new EOS to describe hot beta-stable nuclear matter and to compute various structural properties of nonrotating protoneutron stars. We also apply the EOS to perform dynamical simulations of a spherically symmetric CCSN. The EOS is derived using the finite temperature extension of the Brueckner--Bethe--Goldstone quantum many-body theory in the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock approximation. Neutron star properties are computed by solving the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff structure equations numerically. The sperically symmetric CCSN simulations are performed using the AGILE-IDSA code. Our EOS models are able to reproduce typical features of both PNS and spherically symmetric CCSN simulations. In addition, our EOS model is consistent with present measured neutron star masses and particularly with the masses: ...

title: In situ evidence of ion acceleration between consecutive reconnection jet fronts
authors: Filomena Catapano, Alessandro Retino, Gaetano Zimbardo, et al
topic: Processes driven by unsteady reconnection can efficiently accelerate particles in many astrophysical plasmas. An example are the reconnection jet fronts in an outflow region. We present evidence of suprathermal ion acceleration between two consecutive reconnection jet fronts observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in the terrestrial magnetotail. An earthward propagating jet is approached by a second faster jet. Between the jets, the thermal ions are mostly perpendicular to magnetic field, are trapped and are gradually accelerated in the parallel direction up to 150 keV. Observations suggest that ions are predominantly accelerated by a Fermi-like mechanism in the contracting magnetic bottle formed between the two jet fronts. The ion acceleration mechanism is presumably efficient in other environments where jet fronts produced by variable rates of reconnection are common and where the interaction of multiple jet fronts can also develop a turbulent environment, e.g. in stellar and solar eruptions.

title: Two populations of LIGO-Virgo black holes
authors: Gert Hütsi, Martti Raidal, Ville Vaskonen, Hardi Veermäe
topic: We analyse the LIGO-Virgo data, including the recently released GWTC-2 dataset, to test a hypothesis that the data contains more than one population of black holes. We perform a maximum likelihood analysis including a population of astrophysical black holes with a truncated power-law mass function whose merger rate follows from star formation rate, and a population of primordial black holes for which we consider log-normal and critical collapse mass functions. We find that primordial black holes alone are strongly disfavoured by the data, while the best fit is obtained for the template combining astrophysical and primordial merger rates. Alternatively, the data may hint towards two different astrophysical black hole populations. We also update the constraints on primordial black hole abundance from LIGO-Virgo observations finding that in the 2-400Msun mass range, they must comprise less than 0.2% of dark matter.

topic: Recent detailed 1D core-collapse simulations have brought new insights on the final fate of massive stars, which are in contrast to commonly used parametric prescriptions. In this work, we explore the implications of these results to the formation of coalescing black-hole (BH) - neutron-star (NS) binaries, such as the candidate event GW190426152155 reported in GWTC-2. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of natal kicks and the NS's radius on the synthesis of such systems and potential electromagnetic counterparts linked to them. Synthetic models based on detailed core-collapse simulations result in an increased merger detection rate of BH-NS systems (~2.3 yr-1), 5 to 10 times larger than the predictions of "standard" parametric prescriptions. This is primarily due to the formation of low-mass BH via direct collapse, and hence no natal kicks, favored by the detailed simulations. The fraction of observed systems that will produce an electromagnetic counterpart, with the detailed supernova engine, ranges from 2-25%, depending on uncertainties in the NS equation of state. Notably, in most merging systems with electromagnetic counterparts, the NS is the first-born compact object, as long as the NS's radius is less 12km. Furthermore, core-collapse models that predict the formation of low-mass BHs with negligible natal kicks increase the detection rate of GW190426152155-like events to ~0.6yr-1; with an associated probability of electromagnetic counterpart less 10% for all supernova engines. However, increasing the production of direct-collapse low-mass BHs also increases the synthesis of binary BHs, over-predicting their measured local merger density rate. In all cases, models based on detailed core-collapse simulation predict a ratio of BH-NSs to binary BHs merger rate density that is at least twice as high as other prescriptions.

title: Elevated r-process enrichment in Gaia Sausage and Sequoia
authors: David S. Aguado et al
topic: The Gaia Sausage and the Sequoia represent the major accretion events that formed the stellar halo of the Milky Way. A detailed chemical study of these main building blocks provides a pristine view of the early steps of the Galaxy's assembly. We present the results of the analysis of the UVES high-resolution spectroscopic observations at the 8.2m VLT of 9 Sausage/Sequoia members selected kinematically using Gaia DR2. We season this set of measurements with archival data from Nissen & Schuster (2011) and GALAH DR3 (2020). Here, we focus on the neutron-capture process by analysing Sr, Y, Ba and Eu behavior. We detect clear enhancement in Eu abundance ([Eu/Fe]~0.6-0.7) indicative of large prevalence of r-process in the stellar n-capture makeup. We are also able to trace the evolution of the heavy element production across a wide range of metallicity. Barium to europium ratio changes from a tight, flat sequence with [Ba/Eu]=-0.7 reflecting dominant core-collapse SNe contribution, to a clear upturn at higher iron abundances, betraying the onset of contamination from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta. Additionally, we discover two clear sequences in [Fe/H]-[Ba/Fe] plane likely caused by distinct levels of s-process pollution and mixing within the GS progenitor.

title: A first-principle simulation of blast wave emergence at the photosphere of a neutron star merger
authors: Christoffer Lundman, Andrei Beloborodov
topic: We present the first ab initio simulation of a radiation-mediated shock emerging at the photosphere of a relativistic outflow. The simulation is performed using our code radshock that follows fluid dynamics coupled to time-dependent radiative transfer, calculated with the Monte-Carlo method. We use the code to examine the radiative blast wave emerging from neutron star merger GW~170817. It was previously proposed that the merger ejected a dark, relativistically expanding, homologous envelope, and then an explosion inside the envelope produced the observed gamma-ray burst GRB~170817A. Our simulation demonstrates how the shock wave generates radiation as it propagates through the envelope, approaches its photosphere, releases the radiation, and collapses, splitting into two collisionless shocks of a microscopic thickness. We find the light curve and the spectral evolution of the produced gamma-ray burst; both are similar to the observed GRB~170817A.

authors: Marie-Anne Bizouard, Patricio Maturana-Russel, Alejandro Torres-Forné, Martin Obergaulinger, Pablo Cerdá-Durán, Nelson Christensen, José A. Font, Renate Meyer
topic: The eventual detection of gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) will help improve our current understanding of the explosion mechanism of massive stars. The stochastic nature of the late post-bounce gravitational wave signal due to the non-linear dynamics of the matter involved and the large number of degrees of freedom of the phenomenon make the source parameter inference problem very challenging. In this paper we take a step towards that goal and present a parameter estimation approach which is based on the gravitational waves associated with oscillations of proto-neutron stars (PNS). Numerical simulations of CCSN have shown that buoyancy-driven g-modes are responsible for a significant fraction of the gravitational wave signal and their time-frequency evolution is linked to the physical properties of the compact remnant through universal relation. We use a set of 1D CCSN simulations to build a model that relates the evolution of the PNS properties with the frequency of the dominant g-mode, which is extracted from the gravitational-wave data using a new algorithm we have developed for our study. The model is used to infer the time evolution of a combination of the mass and the radius of the PNS. The performance of the method is estimated employing simulations of 2D CCSN waveforms covering a progenitor mass range between 11 and 40 solar masses and different equations of state. Considering signals embedded in Gaussian gravitational wave detector noise, we show that it is possible to infer PNS properties for a galactic source using Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data at design sensitivities.

title: Morphological evolution of supermassive black hole merger hosts and multimessenger signatures
authors: Colin DeGraf, Debora Sijacki, Tiziana Di Matteo, Kelly Holley-Bockelmann, Greg Snyder, Volker Springel
topic: With the expectation that projects like LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays will detect gravitational waves from supermassive black hole mergers in the near future, it is key that we understand what we can expect those detections to be, and maximize what we can learn from them. To address this, we study the mergers of supermassive black holes in the Illustris simulation, looking at both the overall rate of mergers, and the correlation between merging black holes and the galaxies which host them. We find that these mergers take place in typical galaxies along the MBH-Msun relation, and that between LISA and PTA detections we can expect to probe the full range of galaxy masses. As galaxy mergers can trigger increased star formation, we do find that galaxies hosting low-mass black hole mergers tend to show a slight increase in star formation rates compared to a mass-matched sample. However, high-mass merger hosts have typical star formation rates, due to a combination of low gas fractions and powerful AGN feedback. Although minor black hole mergers do not correlate with disturbed morphologies, major mergers (especially between high-mass black holes) tend to show morphological evidence of a recent galaxy merger which survives for ~500 Myr. However, this typical timescale is of the same order of magnitude as the infall/hardening time of the merging black holes, suggesting that electromagnetic followups to gravitational wave signals may not be able to observe this correlation. We further find that incorporating a realistic timescale delay for the black hole mergers could shift the distribution of merger masses toward higher-mass mergers, decreasing the rate of LISA detections while increasing the rate of PTA detections.

title: The dissipation of toroidal magnetic fields and spin-down evolution of young and strongly magnetized pulsars
authors: Zhi-Fu Gao, Hao Shan, Hui Wang
topic: Magnetars are a kind of pulsars powered mainly by superhigh magnetic fields. They are popular sources with many unsolved issues in themselves, but also linked to various high energy phenomena, such as QPOs, giant flares, fast radio bursts and super-luminous supernovae. In this work, we first review our recent works on the dissipation of toroidal magnetic fields in magnetars and rotationally powered pulsars, then review the spin-down evolution of young and strongly magnetized pulsars, especially of magnetars. We present an interesting and important relation between the magnetization parameter, and magnetic field in the magnetar crust. Finally, we introduce our two works in progress: to explain the magnetar "anti-gltich" events in the thermal plastic flow model and to revisit the expression of braking index n, which is independent of the second derivative of spin frequency of a pulsar and give some proposals for our future work.

topic: We present a detailed multi-wavelength analysis of two short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs) detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory: GRB 160624A at z=0.483 and GRB 200522A at z=0.554. These sGRBs demonstrate very different properties in their observed emission and environment. GRB 160624A is associated to a late-type galaxy with an old stellar population (approx 3 Gyr) and moderate on-going star formation (approx 1 Msun yr-1). Hubble and Gemini limits on optical/nIR emission from GRB 160624A are among the most stringent for sGRBs, leading to tight constraints on the allowed kilonova properties. In particular, we rule out any kilonova brighter than AT2017gfo, disfavoring large masses of wind ejecta (less 0.03 Msun).
In contrast, observations of GRB 200522A uncovered a luminous (LF125W=1042 erg s-1 at 2.3~d) and red (r-H=1.3 mag) counterpart. The red color can be explained either by bright kilonova emission powered by the radioactive decay of a large amount of wind ejecta (0.03 Msun less M less 0.1 Msun) or moderate extinction, E(B-V)=0.1-0.2 mag, along the line of sight. The location of this sGRB in the inner regions of a young (=0.1 Gyr) star-forming (-2-4 Msun yr-1) galaxy and the limited sampling of its counterpart do not allow us to rule out dust effects as contributing, at least in part, to the red color.

title: Neutron tunneling: A new mechanism to power explosive phenomena in neutron stars, magnetars, and neutron star mergers
authors: Carlos A. Bertulani, Ronaldo V. Lobato
topic: Neutron tunneling between neutron-rich nuclei in inhomogeneous dense matter encountered in neutron star crusts can release enormous energy on a short-timescale to power explosive phenomena in neutron stars. In this work we clarify aspects of this process that can occur in the outer regions of neutron stars when oscillations or cataclysmic events increase the ambient density. We use a time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism to determine the rate of neutron diffusion and find that large amounts of energy can be released rapidly. The role of nuclear binding, the two-body interaction and pairing, on the neutron diffusion times is investigated. We consider a one-dimensional quantum diffusion model and extend our analysis to study the impact of diffusion in three-dimensions. We find that these novel neutron transfer reactions can generate energy at the amount of

In contrast to the scenario for the merger of two neutron stars of comparable masses considered repeatedly in the literature, the evolution of such a binary at the final stage consists in a rapid mass transfer to the more massive star and an explosive disruption of the low-mass component. We provide the details of the explosion and calculate the abundances of the heavy elements produced in this process for various initial conditions.

title: Constraints on Nuclear Saturation Properties from Terrestrial Experiments and Astrophysical Observations of Neutron Stars
authors: Soonchul Choi, Tsuyoshi Miyatsu, Myung-Ki Cheoun, Koichi Saito
topic: Taking into account the terrestrial experiments and the recent astrophysical observations of neutron stars and gravitational-wave signals, we impose restrictions on the equation of state (EoS) for isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. Using the relativistic mean-field model with SU(3) flavor symmetry, we investigate the impacts of effective nucleon mass, nuclear incompressibility, and slope parameter of nuclear symmetry energy on the nuclear and neutron-star properties. It is found that the astrophysical information of massive neutron stars and tidal deformabilities as well as the nuclear experimental data plays an important role to restrict the EoS for neutron stars. Especially, the softness of the nuclear EoS due to the existence of hyperons in the core gives stringent constraints on those physical quantities. Furthermore, it is possible to put limits on the curvature parameter of nuclear symmetry energy by means of the nuclear and astrophysical calculations.

title: The scattering order problem in Monte Carlo radiative transfer
authors: A. Krieger, S. Wolf
topic: Radiative transfer simulation is an important tool that allows us to generate synthetic images of various astrophysical objects. In the case of complex three-dimensional geometries, a Monte Carlo-based method that simulates photon packages as they move through and interact with their environment is often used. Previous studies have shown, in the regime of high optical depths, that the required number of simulated photon packages strongly rises and estimated fluxes may be severely underestimated. In this paper we identify two problems that arise for Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations that hinder a proper determination of flux: first, a mismatch between the probability and weight of the path of a photon package and second, the necessity of simulating a wide range of high scattering orders. Furthermore, we argue that the peel-off method partly solves these problems, and we additionally propose an extended peel-off method. Our proposed method improves several shortcomings of its basic variant and relies on the utilization of precalculated sphere spectra. We then combine both peel-off methods with the Split method and the Stretch method and numerically evaluate their capabilities as opposed to the pure Split&Stretch method in an infinite plane-parallel slab setup. We find that the peel-off method greatly enhances the performance of these simulations; in particular, at a transverse optical depth of taumax=75 our method achieved a significantly lower error than previous methods while simultaneously saving more 95% computation time. Finally, we discuss the inclusion of polarization and Mie-scattering in the extended peel-off method, and argue that it may be necessary to equip future Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with additional advanced pathfinding techniques.

title: Magnetic outflows from turbulent accretion disks: I. Vertical structure & secular evolution
authors: J. Jacquemin-Ide, G. Lesur, J. Ferreira
topic: Astrophysical disks are likely embedded in an ambient vertical magnetic field. This ambient field is known to drive magneto-rotational turbulence in the disk bulk but is also responsible for the launching of magnetized outflows at the origin of astrophysical jets. The vertical structure and long-term (secular) evolution of such a system lack quantitative predictions. It is nevertheless this secular evolution that is proposed to explain time variability in many accreting systems such as X-ray binaries. We compute and analyze global 3D ideal-MHD simulations of an accretion disk threaded by a large-scale magnetic field. We evaluate the role of the turbulent terms in the equilibrium of the system. We then compute the transport of mass, angular momentum, and magnetic fields in the disk to characterize its secular evolution. We perform a parameter survey to characterize the influence of disk properties on secular transport.
We find that weakly magnetized disks drive jets that carry away a small fraction of the disk angular momentum. The mass-weighted accretion speed remains subsonic although, there is always an upper turbulent atmospheric region where transonic accretion takes place. We show that a strongly magnetized version of the magneto-rotational instability drives this turbulence. The disk structure is drastically different from the conventional hydrostatic picture. The magnetic field is always dragged inwards in the disk, at a velocity that increases with the disk magnetization. Beyond a threshold on the latter, the disk undergoes a profound radial readjustment. It leads to the formation of an inner accretion-ejection region with a supersonic mass-weighted accretion speed and where the magnetic field distribution becomes steady, near equipartition with the thermal pressure. This inner structure shares many properties with the Jet Emitting Disk model described by Ferreira (1997).

title: A numerical approach for radiative cooling in relativistic outflows
authors: Jesús M. Rueda-Becerril
topic: In high energy astrophysics scenarios such as blazars, GRBs or PWNe, it is highly probable that ultra-relativistic particles interact with photons in their environment through scattering. As long as the energy of the particle is greater than the energy of the interacting photon, the (classical) scattering is known to be in the Thomson regime. Otherwise, quantum effects will affect the scattering cross section, and we enter into the so-called Klein-Nishina regime. It is well known that radiative cooling in the Thomson regime is very efficient, leading to soft high-energy spectra. However, observations have shown that, in many cases, the high energy spectrum of some objects is rather hard. This has led to think that maybe particles are not being cooled down efficiently. Asymptotic approximations of the Klein-Nishina regime have been formulated in the last decades in order to account for these corrections in the distribution of particles responsible for the observed spectrum of high energy sources. In this work we presenta a numerical approach of the Klein-Nishina corrections to the radiative cooling. It has been developed to simulate the evolution of a distribution of particles interacting with photons in their surroundings via inverse Compton scattering.

title: Model independent calibrations of gamma ray bursts using machine learning
authors: Orlando Luongo, Marco Muccino
topic: We alleviate the circularity problem, whereby gamma-ray bursts are not perfect distance indicators, by means of a new model-independent technique based on Bézier polynomials. To do so, we use the well consolidate \textit{Amati} and \textit{Combo} correlations. We consider improved calibrated catalogs of mock data from differential Hubble rate points. To get our mock data, we use those machine learning scenarios that well adapt to gamma ray bursts, discussing in detail how we handle small amounts of data from our machine learning techniques. In particular, we explore only three machine learning treatments, i.e. \emph{linear regression}, \emph{neural network} and \emph{random forest}, emphasizing quantitative statistical motivations behind these choices. Our calibration strategy consists in taking Hubble's data, creating the mock compilation using machine learning and calibrating the aforementioned correlations through Bézier polynomials with a standard chi-square analysis first and then by means of a hierarchical Bayesian regression procedure. The corresponding catalogs, built up from the two correlations, have been used to constrain dark energy scenarios. We thus employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical analyses based on the most recent Pantheon supernova data, baryonic acoustic oscillations and our gamma ray burst data. We test the standard ΛCDM model and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. We discuss the recent H0 tension in view of our results. Moreover, we highlight a further severe tension over Ωm and we conclude that a slight evolving dark energy model is possible.

title: Modelling Neutron Star-Black Hole Binaries: Future Pulsar Surveys and Gravitational Wave Detectors
authors: Debatri Chattopadhyay, Simon Stevenson, Jarrod R. Hurley, Matthew Bailes, Floor Broekgaarden
topic: Binaries comprised of a neutron star (NS) and a black hole (BH) have so far eluded observations as pulsars and with gravitational waves (GWs). We model the formation and evolution of these NS+BH binaries including pulsar evolution using the binary population synthesis code COMPAS. We predict the presence of a total of 50-1300 binaries containing a pulsar and a BH (PSR+BHs) in the Galactic field. We find the population observable by the next-generation of radio telescopes, represented by the SKA and MeerKAT, current (LIGO/Virgo) and future (LISA) GW detectors. We conclude that the SKA will observe 1-60 PSR+BHs, with 0-4 binaries containing millisecond pulsars. MeerKAT is expected to observe 0-30 PSR+BH systems. Future radio detections of NS+BHs will constrain uncertain binary evolution processes such as BH natal kicks. We show that systems in which the NS formed first (NSBH) can be distinguished from those where the BH formed first (BHNS) by their pulsar and binary properties. We find 40% of the LIGO/Virgo observed NS+BHs from a Milky-Way like field population will have a chirp mass geq 3.0 Msun. We estimate the spin distributions of NS+BHs with two models for the spins of BHs. The remnants of BHNS mergers will have a spin of ~0.4, whilst NSBH merger remnants can have a spin of ~0.6 or ~0.9 depending on the model for BH spins. We estimate that approximately 25-930 PSR+BHs will be radio alive whilst emitting GWs in the LISA frequency band, raising the possibility of joint observation by the SKA and LISA.

title: Partial Stellar Explosions -- Ejected Mass and Minimal Energy
authors: Itai Linial, Jim Fuller, Re'em Sari
topic: Many massive stars appear to undergo enhanced mass loss during late stages of their evolution. In some cases, the ejected mass likely originates from non-terminal explosive outbursts, rather than continuous winds. Here we study the dependence of the ejecta mass, mej, on the energy budget E of an explosion deep within the star, using both analytical arguments and numerical hydrodynamics simulations. Focusing on polytropic stellar models, we find that for explosion energies smaller than the stellar binding energy, the ejected mass scales as mej = E to m, where e to m=2.4-3.0 depending on the polytropic index. The loss of energy due to shock breakout emission near the stellar edge leads to the existence of a minimal mass-shedding explosion energy, corresponding to a minimal ejecta mass. For a wide range of progenitors, from Wolf-Rayet stars to red supergiants, we find a similar limiting energy of Emin approx 1046-1047erg, almost independent of the stellar radius. The corresponding minimal ejecta mass varies considerably across different progenitors, ranging from ~10-8Msun in compact stars, up to ~10-2Msun in red supergiants. We discuss implications of our results for pre-supernova outbursts driven by wave heating, and complications caused by the non-constant opacity and adiabatic index of realistic stars.

title: Bounds on Neutron- Mirror Neutron Mixing from Pulsar Timings and Gravitational Wave Detections
authors: Itzhak Goldman, Rabindra N. Mohapatra, Shmuel Nussinov
topic: The mass loss in putative neutron star to mixed neutron - mirror neutron star transition implies a significant change of orbital period. The precise constancy of the latter can restrict scenarios recently suggested where neutron to mirror neutron mixing occurring in neutron stars, transforms them into mixed stars helping explain the narrow mass distribution observed for pulsars in binary systems. The observation of a very old millisecond pulsar with a mass of 2 solar masses is an additional strong constraint on the above transition. We also note that the observed gravitational waves signals from neutron-neutron stars merger constrain the neutron to mirror neutron transitions inside neutron stars. These considerations exclude a large region in the plane of the neutron-mirror neutron mixing and mass

title: Simulations of neutrino and gamma-ray production from relativistic black-hole microquasar jets
authors: Th. V. Papavasileiou, O. T. Kosmas, J. Sinatkas
topic: Recently, microquasar jets have aroused the interest of many researchers focusing on the astrophysical plasma outflows and various jet ejections. In this work, we concentrate on the investigation of electromagnetic radiation and particle emissions from the jets of stellar black hole binary systems characterized by their hadronic content in their jets. Such emissions are reliably described within the context of the relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics. Our model calculations are based on the Fermi acceleration mechanism through which the primary particles (mainly protons) of the jet are accelerated. As a result, a small portion of thermal protons of the jet acquire relativistic energies, through shock-waves generated into the jet plasma. From the inelastic collisions of fast (non-thermal) protons with the thermal (cold) ones, secondary charged and neutral particles (pions, kaons, muons, eta-particles, etc.) are created as well as electromagnetic radiation from the radio wavelength band, to X-rays and even to very high energy gamma-ray emission. One of our main goals is, through the appropriate solution of the transport equation and taking into account the various mechanisms that cause energy losses to the particles, to study the secondary particle distributions within hadronic astrophysical jets. After testing our method on the Galactic MQs SS 433 and Cyg X-1, as a concrete extragalactic binary system, we examine the LMC X-1 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way Galaxy. It is worth mentioning that, for the companion O star (and its extended nebula structure) of the LMC X-1 system, new observations using spectroscopic data from VLT/UVES have been published few years ago.

title: R-mode Stability of GW190814's Secondary Component as a Supermassive and Superfast Pulsar
authors: Xia Zhou, Ang Li, Bao-An Li
topic: The nature of GW190814's secondary component m2 of mass (2.50-2.67)Msun in the mass gap between the currently known maximum mass of neutron stars and the minimum mass of black holes is currently under hot debate. Among the many possibilities proposed in the literature, the m2 was suggested as a superfast pulsar while its r-mode stability against the run-away gravitational radiation through the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz mechanism is still unknown. Using those fulfilling all currently known astrophysical and nuclear physics constraints among a sample of 33 unified equation of states (EOSs) constructed previously by Fortin (2016) using the same nuclear interactions from the crust to the core consistently, we compare the minimum frequency required for the m2 to rotationally sustain a mass higher than 2.50Msun with the critical frequency above which the r-mode instability occurs. We use two extreme damping models assuming the crust is either perfectly rigid or elastic. Using the stability of 19 observed low-mass x-ray binaries as an indication that the rigid crust damping of the r-mode dominates within the models studied, we find that the m2 is r-mode stable while rotating with a frequency higher than 870.2 Hz (0.744 times its Kepler frequency of 1169.6 Hz) as long as its temperate is lower than about 3.9x107K, further supporting the proposal that GW190814's secondary component is a supermassive and superfast pulsar.

authors: G. Wendell Misch, T. M. Sprouse, M. R. Mumpower
topic: We study the impact of astrophysically relevant nuclear isomers (astromers) in the context of the rapid neutron capture process (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We compute thermally mediated transition rates between long-lived isomers and the corresponding ground states in neutron-rich nuclei. We calculate the temperature-dependent beta-decay feeding factors which represent the fraction of material going to each of the isomer and ground state daughter species from the beta-decay parent species. We simulate nucleosynthesis by including as separate species nuclear excited states with measured terrestrial half-lives greater than 100 microseconds. We find a variety of isomers throughout the chart of nuclides are populated, and we identify those most likely to be influential. We comment on the capacity of isomer production to alter radioactive heating in an r-process environment.

title: Equilibrium sequences of differentially rotating stars with post-merger-like rotational profiles
authors: Panagiotis Iosif, Nikolaos Stergioulas
topic: We present equilibrium sequences of rotating relativistic stars, constructed with a new rotation law that was proposed by Uryu et al. (2017). We choose rotational parameters motivated by simulations of binary neutron star merger remnants, but otherwise adopt a cold, relativistic N=1 polytropic EOS, in order to perform a detailed comparison to published equilibrium sequences that used the Komatsu, Eriguchi and Hachisu (1989) rotation law. We find a small influence of the choice of rotation law on the mass of the equilibrium models and a somewhat larger influence on their radius. The versatility of the new rotation law allows us to construct models that have a similar rotational profile and axis ratio as observed for merger remnants, while at the same time being quasi-spherical. While our models are highly accurate solutions of the fully general relativistic structure equations, we demonstrate that for models relevant to merger remnants the IWM-CFC approximation still maintains an acceptable accuracy.

title: QCD equations of state and speed of sound in neutron stars
authors: Toru Kojo
topic: Neutron stars are cosmic laboratories to study dense matter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The observable mass-radius relations of neutron stars are determined by QCD equations of state, and can reflect the properties of QCD phase transitions. In the last decade there have been historical discoveries in neutron stars, the discoveries of two-solar mass neutron stars and neutron star merger events, which have imposed tight constraints on equations of state. While a number of equations of state are constructed to satisfy these constraints, a theoretical challenge is how to reconcile those constructions with the microphysics expected from the hadron physics and in-medium calculations. In this short article we briefly go over recent observations and discuss their implications for dense QCD matter, referring to QCD constraints in the low and high density limits, QCD-like theories, and lattice QCD results for baryon-baryon interactions.

Hybrid kinetic simulations, where a turbulent jet is slammed against an oblique shock, are employed to address the role of upstream turbulence on plasma transport. A novel technique, using coarse-graining of the Vlasov equation, is proposed, showing that the transport properties strongly depend on upstream turbulence strength, with turbulent structures-modulated patterns. These results might be relevant for the understanding of acceleration and heating processes in space plasmas.

title: Axisymmetric models for neutron star merger remnants with realistic thermal and rotational profiles
authors: Giovanni Camelio, Tim Dietrich, Stephan Rosswog, Brynmor Haskell
topic: Merging neutron stars are expected to produce hot, metastable remnants in rapid differential rotation, which subsequently cool and evolve into rigidly rotating neutron stars or collapse to black holes. Studying this metastable phase and its further evolution is essential for the prediction and interpretation of the electromagnetic, neutrino, and gravitational signals from such a merger. In this work, we model binary neutron star merger remnants and propose new rotation and thermal laws that describe post-merger remnants. Our framework is capable to reproduce quasi-equilibrium configurations for generic equations of state, rotation and temperature profiles, including nonbarotropic ones. We demonstrate that our results are in agreement with numerical relativity simulations concerning bulk remnant properties like the mass, angular momentum, and the formation of a massive accretion disk. Because of the low computational cost for our axisymmetric code compared to full 3+1-dimensional simulations, we can perform an extensive exploration of the binary neutron star remnant parameter space studying several hundred thousand configurations for different equation of states.

title: Gravitational-wave Signals From Three-dimensional Supernova Simulations With Different Neutrino-Transport Methods
authors: Haakon Andresen, Robert Glas, H-Thomas Janka 
topic: We compare gravitational-wave (GW) signals from eight three-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae from Glas et al. (2019), using two different progenitors with zero-age main sequence masses of 9 and 20 solar masses. The collapse of each progenitor was simulated four times, at two different grid resolutions and with two different neutrino transport methods, using the Aenus-Alcar code. The main goal of this study is to assess the validity of recent concerns that the so-called "Ray-by-Ray+" (RbR+) approximation is problematic in core-collapse simulations and can adversely affect theoretical GW predictions. Therefore, signals from simulations using RbR+ are compared to signals from corresponding simulations using a fully multidimensional (FMD) transport scheme. The 9 solar-mass progenitor successfully explodes, whereas the 20 solar-mass model does not. Both the standing accretion shock instability and hot-bubble convection develop in the postshock layer of the non-exploding models. In the exploding models, neutrino-driven convection in the postshock flow is established around 100 ms after core bounce and lasts until the onset of shock revival. We can, therefore, judge the impact of the numerical resolution and neutrino transport under all conditions typically seen in non-rotating core-collapse simulations. We find excellent qualitative agreement in all GW features and mostly very satisfactory quantitative agreement between simulations using the different transport schemes. Overall, resolution-dependent differences in the hydrodynamic behaviour of low-resolution and high-resolution models turn out to have a greater impact on the GW signals than consequences of the different transport methods. Furthermore, increasing the resolution decreases the discrepancies between models with different neutrino transport.

authors: Mouza Almualla, Shreya Anand, Michael W. Coughlin, Tim Dietrich, Nidhal Guessoum, Ana Sagués Carracedo, Tomás Ahumada, Igor Andreoni, Sarah Antier, Eric C. Bellm, Mattia Bulla, Leo P. Singer
topic: The rise of multi-messenger astronomy has brought with it the need to exploit all available data streams and learn more about the astrophysical objects that fall within its breadth. One possible avenue is the search for serendipitous electromagnetic counterparts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and gravitational-wave signals, known as kilonovae. With surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which observes the sky with a cadence of ~ three days, the existing counterpart locations are likely to be observed; however, due to the significant amount of sky to explore, it is difficult to search for these fast-evolving candidates. It is thus beneficial for the survey cadence to be optimized to find and identify transients of this type such that further photometric and spectroscopic observations can be made. We explore how to improve the cadence of wide field-of-view surveys like ZTF to enable such identifications. We show that with improved observational choices, e.g., the adoption of a ~ nightly cadence and the prioritization of redder photometric bands, detection rates improve by about a factor of two relative to the nominal cadence. These results demonstrate how an optimal use of ZTF increases the likelihood of kilonova discovery independent of gravitational waves or GRBs, thereby allowing for a sensitive search with less interruption of its nominal cadence through Target of Opportunity programs.

title: "Slow" Radio Bursts from Galactic Magnetars?
authors: Bing Zhang
topic: Recently, one fast radio burst, FRB 200428, was detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during one X-ray burst. This suggests that magnetars can make FRBs. On the other hand, the majority of X-ray bursts from SGR J1935+2154 are not associated with FRBs. One possible reason of such rarity of FRB-SGR-burst associations is that the FRB emission is much more narrowly beamed than SGR burst emission. If such an interpretation is true, one would expect to detect radio bursts with viewing angle somewhat outside the narrow emission beam. These "slow" radio bursts (SRBs) would have broader widths and lower flux densities due to the smaller Doppler factor involved. The 2.2-s long, 111 MHz radio burst detected from SGR J1935+2154 by the BSA LPI radio telescope may be such an SRB if the spectral slope is positive. If the FRB beam is narrow, there should be many more SRBs than FRBs from Galactic magnetars. Non-detection of these SRBs would disfavor the assumption that all SGR bursts are associated with narrow-beam FRBs.

title: The evolution of a newborn millisecond magnetar with a propeller-recycling disk
authors: Shao-Ze Li, Yun-Wei Yu, He Gao, Bing Zhang
topic: A rapidly rotating and highly magnetized neutron star (NS) could be formed from the explosive phenomena such as superluminous supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. This newborn NS can substantially influence the emission of these explosive transients through its spin-down. The spin-down evolution of the NS can sometimes be affected by fallback accretion, although it is usually regulated by the magnetic dipole radiation and gravitational wave radiation of the NS. Under appropriate conditions, the accreting material can be firstly ejected and subsequently recycled back, so that the accretion disk can keep in a quasi-steady state for a long time. Here we describe the interaction of the NS with such a propeller-recycling disk and their co-evolution. Our result shows that, the spin-down of the NS can be initially dominated by the propeller, which prevents the disk material from falling onto the NS until hundreds or thousands of seconds later. It is suggested that the abrupt fall of the disk material onto the NS could significantly suppress the magnetic dipole radiation and then convert the NS from a normal magnetar to a low-field magnetar. This evolution behavior of the newborn NS can help to understand the very different influence of the NS on the early GRB afterglows and the late supernova/kilonova emission.

title: Heat release in accreting neutron stars
authors: Mikhail E. Gusakov, Andrey I. Chugunov
topic: Observed thermal emission from accreting neutron stars (NSs) in a quiescent state is believed to be powered by nonequilibrium nuclear reactions that heat the stellar crust (deep crustal heating paradigm). We derive a simple universal formula for the heating efficiency, assuming that an NS has a fully accreted crust. We further show that, within the recently proposed thermodynamically consistent approach to the accreted crust, the heat release can be parametrized by the only one parameter -- the pressure Poi at the outer-inner crust interface (as we argue, this pressure should not necessarily coincide with the neutron-drip pressure). We discuss possible values of Poi for a selection of nuclear models that account for shell effects, and determine the net heat release and its distribution in the crust as a function of Poi. We conclude that the heat release should be reduced by a factor of few in comparison to previous works.

title: Black hole-neutron star coalescence: effects of the neutron star spin on jet launching and dynamical ejecta mass
authors: Milton Ruiz, Vasileios Paschalidis, Antonios Tsokaros, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: Black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers are thought to be sources of gravitational waves (GWs) with coincident electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. To further probe whether these systems are viable progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and kilonovae, and how one may use (the lack of) EM counterparts associated with LIGO/Virgo candidate BHNS GW events to sharpen parameter estimation, we study the impact of neutron star spin in BHNS mergers. Using dynamical spacetime magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNSs initially on a quasicircular orbit, we survey configurations that differ in the BH spin, and the binary mass ratio. The general trend we find is that increasing the NS prograde spin increases both the rest mass of the accretion disk onto the remnant black hole, and the rest mass of dynamically ejected matter. a magnetically--driven jet is launched only for q=3:1 regardless of the initial NS spin. The lifetime of the jets 1.5s. and their outgoing Poynting luminosity are consistent with typical sGRBs luminosities and expectations from the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. By the time we terminate our simulations, we do not observe either an outflow or a large-scale magnetic field collimation for the other systems we considered.

title: Binary Neutron Star Mergers in AGN Accretion Disks: Cocoon and Ejecta Shock Breakouts
authors: Jin-Ping Zhu, Bing Zhang, Yun-Wei Yu, He Gao
topic: Compact binary coalescences are believed to occur in accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Here we show that a putative jet launched from the merger of a binary neutron star (BNS) or a neutron star--black hole (NSBH) binary occurred at the migration trap in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk would be choked. The jet energy is deposited within the disk materials to power a hot cocoon. The cocoon is energetic enough to break out from the AGN disk and produce a bright X-ray shock breakout transient peaking at ~0.15d after the merger. The peak luminosity is estimated as ~1046ergs−1, which can be discovered by Einstein Probe from zless0.5. Later on, the non-relativistic ejecta launched from the merger would break out the disk, powering an X-ray/UV flare peaking at ~0.5d after the merger. This second shock breakout signal may be detected by UV transient searches. The cocoon cooling emission and kilonova emission are outshone by the disk emission. Future joint observations of gravitational waves from BNS/NSBH mergers and associated two shock breakout signatures can provide a strong support for the compact binary coalescence formation channel in AGN disks.

title: s-Processing in AGB Stars Revisited. III. Neutron captures from MHD mixing at different metallicities and observational constraints
authors: Maurizio Busso, Diego Vescovi, Sara Palmerini, Sergio Cristallo, Vincenzo Antonuccio Delogu
topic: We present post process neutron capture computations for Asymptotic Giant Branch stars of 1.5 to 3 Msun and metallicities -1.3 to 0.1. The reference stellar models are computed with the FRANEC code, using the Schwarzschild's criterion for convection. Motivations for this choice are outlined. We assume that MHD processes induce the penetration of protons below the convective boundary, when the third dredge up occurs. There, the 13C(alpha,n)16O neutron source can subsequently operate, merging its effects with those of the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction, activated at the temperature peaks characterizing AGB stages. This work has three main scopes. i) We provide a grid of abundance yields, as produced through our MHD mixing scheme, uniformly sampled in mass and metallicity. From it, we deduce that the solar s process distribution, as well as the abundances in recent stellar populations, can be accounted for, without the need of the extra primary like contributions suggested in the past. ii) We formulate analytical expressions for the mass of the 13C pockets generated, in order to allow easy verification of our findings. iii) We compare our results with observations of evolved stars and with isotopic ratios in presolar SiC grains, also noticing how some flux tubes should survive turbulent disruption, carrying C rich materials into the winds even when the envelope is O rich. This wind phase is approximated through the G component of AGB s processing. We conclude that MHD induced mixing is adequate to drive slow neutron capture phenomena accounting for observations. Our prescriptions should permit its inclusion into current stellar evolutionary codes.

title: Emission of magnetar bursts and precursors of neutron star mergers
authors: Andrei M. Beloborodov
topic: Magnetar bursts can be emitted by Alfven waves growing in the outer magnetosphere to nonlinear amplitudes, and triggering magnetic reconnection. Similar magnetic flares should occur quasi-periodically in a magnetized neutron star binary nearing merger. In both cases, fast dissipation in the magnetic flare creates optically thick e+e- plasma, whose heat capacity is negligible compared with the generated radiation energy. Magnetic dissipation then involves photon viscosity and acts through Compton drag on the plasma bulk motions in the reconnection region. The effective temperature of the resulting Comptonization process is self-regulated to tens of keV. The generated X-ray emission is calculated using time-dependent radiative transfer simulations, which follow the creation of e+e- pairs and the production, Comptonization, and escape of photons. The simulations show how the dissipation region becomes dressed in an e+e- coat, and how the escaping spectrum is shaped by radiative transfer through the coat. The results are compared with observed magnetar bursts, including the recent activity of SGR~1935+2154 accompanied by a fast radio burst. Predictions are made for X-ray precursors of magnetized neutron star mergers.

title: Igniting weak interactions in neutron-star post-merger accretion disks
authors: Soumi De, Daniel Siegel
topic: The merger of two neutron stars or of a neutron star and a black hole typically results in the formation of a post-merger accretion disk. Outflows from disks may dominate the overall ejecta from mergers and be a major source of r-process nuclei in our universe. We explore the parameter space of such disks, their outflows, and r-process yields by performing three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations with weak interactions and approximate neutrino transport. We discuss the mapping between initial binary parameters and the parameter space of resulting disks, chiefly characterized by their initial accretion rate. We demonstrate the existence of an ignition threshold for weak interactions at around ~10-3Msun-1 for typical parameters by means of analytic calculations within a 1D alpha-viscosity disk model and by explicit GRMHD simulations. Focusing on the qualitative change in disk physics across the ignition threshold, we find a degenerate, self-regulated, neutrino-cooled regime above the threshold and an advection dominated regime below the threshold. Excess heating in the absence of neutrino cooling below the threshold leads to greater 60% of the initial disk mass being ejected in outflows, with typical velocities ~(0.1-0.2)c in the model we simulate, compared to less then 40% at ~(0.1−0.15)c above the threshold. While disks below the threshold show suppressed production of light r-process elements, disks above the threshold can produce the entire range of r-process elements in good agreement with the observed solar system abundances. Disks below the ignition threshold may produce an overabundance of actinides seen in actinide-boost stars. As gravitational-wave detectors start to sample the neutron-star merger parameter space, different disk realizations may be observable via their associated kilonova emission.

The magnetar was observed in a period of intense X-ray bursting activity and enhanced X-ray emission. We report here on the detection of two radio bursts from 1E1547.0-5408, reminiscent of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). One of the radio bursts was anticipated by ~1s (about half a rotation period of the pulsar) by a bright SGR-like X-ray burst, resulting in a []. Radio pulsations were not detected during the observation showing the FRB-like radio bursts, while they were detected in the previous radio observation. We also found that the two radio bursts are neither aligned with the latter radio pulsations nor with the peak of the X-ray pulse profile (phase shift of ~0.2). Comparing the luminosity of these FRB-like bursts and those reported from SGR1935+2154, we find that the wide range in radio efficiency and/or luminosity of magnetar bursts in the Galaxy may bridge the gap between "ordinary" pulsar radio bursts and the extragalactic FRB phenomenon.

title: Model of heat diffusion in the outer crust of bursting neutron stars
authors: D. G. Yakovlev, A. D. Kaminker, A. Y. Potekhin, P. Haensel
topic: We study heat diffusion after an energy release in a deep spherical layer of the outer neutron star crust. We demonstrate that this layer possesses specific heat-accumulating properties, absorbing heat and directing it mostly inside the star. It can absorb up to about [] due to its high heat capacity, until its temperature exceeds []K and triggers a rapid neutrino cooling. A warm layer with []K can serve as a good heat reservoir, which is thermally decoupled from the inner crust and the stellar core for a few months. We present a toy model to explore the heat diffusion within the heat-accumulating layer, and we test this model using numerical simulations. We formulate some generic features of the heat propagation which can be useful, for instance, for the interpretation of superbursts in accreting neutron stars. We present a self-similar analysis of late afterglow after such superbursts, which can be helpful to estimate properties of bursting stars.

The late afterglow of GRB 170817A has been described by a structured jet seen slightly off-axis (at an observer angle of 20-30deg). Studies of the jet dynamics and propagation usually assume that the jet is ejected from the central engine with a top-hat structure and its final structure, which determines the observed light curve and spectra, is primarily regulated by the interaction with the nearby environment. However, relativistic jets are expected to be produced with a structure that is more complex than a simple top-hat, as shown by global accretion simulations. In this work, we present results of numerical simulations of short GRBs launched with a wide range of initial structures, durations, luminosities, and ejection time histories. We follow the interaction of the jet with the pre-collapse, merger remnant wind and compute its final structure at distances 10to11~cm from the central engine. We show that the final jet structure, as well as the resulting afterglow emission (at much larger distances), depend strongly on the initial structure of the jet, its luminosity and duration. We find that the initial structure at the jet is preserved for long-lasting sGRBs, while it is strongly modified for jets barely making their way through the wind. This illustrates the importance of combining the results of global simulations with propagation studies in order to better predict the expected afterglow signatures from neutron star mergers. Structured jets provide a reasonable description of the GRB 170817A afterglow emission with an off-axis angle θobs=22.5∘ while top-hat jets do not.

title: The Non Relativistic Interiors of Ultra-Relativistic Explosions: Extension to the Blandford McKee Solutions
authors: Tamar Faran, Re'em Sari
topic: The hydrodynamics of an ultrarelativistic flow, enclosed by a strong shock wave, are described by the well known Blandford-McKee solutions in spherical geometry. These solutions, however, become inaccurate at a distance ~R/2 behind the shock wave, where R is the shock radius, as the flow approaches Newtonian velocities. In this work we find a new self-similar solution which is an extension to the Blandford-McKee solutions, and which describes the interior part of the blast wave, where the flow reaches mildly relativistic to Newtonian velocities. We find that the velocity profile of the internal part of the flow does not depend on the value of the shock Lorentz factor, Gamma, and is accurate from r=0 down to a distance of R/Gamma2 behind the shock. Despite the fact that the shock wave is in causal contact with the entire flow behind it, a singular point appears in the equations. Nevertheless, the solution is not required to pass through the singular point: for ambient density that decreases slowly enough, rho prop to r-k with, a secondary shock wave forms with an inflow at the origin.

title: Magnetized tori in the background of a deformed compact object
authors: Shokoufe Faraji, Audrey Trova
topic: In this paper, we studied the relativistic accretion thick disc model raised by a deformed compact object up to the quadrupole moment. The goal of this work is to study the space-time and the effects of quadrupole moments via studying the properties of these equilibrium sequences of magnetized, non-self-gravitating discs in this space-time. We employed different angular momentum distributions and discussed the procedure of building this toroidal disc model based on a combination of approaches previously considered in the literature. We have shown the properties of this relativistic accretion disc model and its dependence on the initial parameters. Besides, this theoretical model can serve as the initial data for numerical simulations.

title: Polarized Radiation Transfer in Neutron Star Surface Layers
authors: Joseph A. Barchas, Kun Hu, Matthew G. Baring
topic: The study of polarized radiation transfer in the highly-magnetized surface locales of neutron stars is of great interest to the understanding of accreting X-ray pulsars, rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars. This paper explores scattering transport in the classical magnetic Thomson domain that is of broad applicability to these neutron star classes. The development of a Monte Carlo simulation for the polarized radiative transfer is detailed: it employs an electric field vector formalism to enable a breadth of utility in relating linear, circular and elliptical polarizations. The simulation can be applied to any neutron star surface locale, and is adaptable to accretion column and magnetospheric problems. Validation of the code for both intensity and Stokes parameter determination is illustrated in a variety of ways. Representative results for emergent polarization signals from surface layers are presented for both polar and equatorial magnetic locales, exhibiting contrasting signatures between the two regions. There is also a strong dependence of these characteristics on the ratio of the frequency of a photon to the cyclotron frequency. Polarization signatures for high opacity domains are presented, highlighting compact analytic approximations for the Stokes parameters and anisotropy relative to the local field direction for an extended range of frequencies. These are very useful in defining injection conditions deep in the simulation slab geometries, expediting the generation of emission signals from highly opaque stellar atmospheres. The results are interpreted throughout using the polarization characteristics of the magnetic Thomson differential cross section.

title: The first five years of gravitational-wave astrophysics
authors: Salvatore Vitale
topic: Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime generated by the acceleration of astrophysical objects. A direct consequence of Einstein's general relativity, they were directly observed for the first time in 2015 by the twin LIGO observatories. Five years later, tens of gravitational waves have been detected, emitted by pairs of merging compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes. These signals yield insights about the formation of compact objects and their progenitor stars; they enable stringent tests of general relativity and reveal the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities. Bright mergers, emitting both gravitational and electromagnetic waves, are unique probes of the formation of short gamma ray bursts and of heavy elements, and can be used to measure the local expansion rate of the universe.

topic: In the present work, we would like to elaborate on Shakura Sunyaev Alpha disk model. To be more concrete, inclusion of the effect of the radiation pressure on the accretion phenomena have been carefully studied. To summarize, the present modification of Shakura Sunyaev Alpha disk model of disk accretion can be regarded as a new candidate theory of ADAF. Reduction of accreting matter's angular velocity leads to the suppression of the disk luminosity and the surface temperature which essentially implies the transition of the standard accretion disk model from CDAF to ADAF.

title: Fast magnetic reconnection structures in Poynting-flux dominated jets
authors: Luís H.S Kadowaki, Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino, Tania E. Medina Torrejon, Yosuke Mizuno, Pankaj Kushwaha
topic: The ubiquitous relativistic jet phenomena associated with black holes play a major role in high and very-high-energy (VHE) astrophysics. In particular, observations have demonstrated that blazars show VHE emission with time-variability from days (in the GeV band) to minutes (in the TeV band), implying very compact emission regions. The real mechanism able to explain the particle acceleration process responsible for this emission is still debated, but magnetic reconnection has been lately discussed as a strong potential candidate and, in some circumstances, as the only possible one. In this work, we present the results of three-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the development of reconnection events driven by turbulence induced by current-driven kink instability along a relativistic jet. ... This suggests that turbulent fast magnetic reconnection driven by kink instability can be a possible process behind the high energy emission variability phenomena observed in blazars.

topic: The first detection of a binary neutron star merger through gravitational waves and photons marked the dawn of multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves, and it greatly increased our insight in different fields of astrophysics and fundamental physics. However, many open questions on the physical process involved in a compact binary merger still remain and many of these processes concern plasma physics. With the second generation of gravitational wave interferometers approaching their design sensitivity, the new generation under design study, and new X-ray detectors under development, the high energy Universe will become more and more a unique laboratory for our understanding of plasma in extreme conditions. In this review, we discuss the main electromagnetic signals expected to follow the merger of two compact objects highlighting the main physical processes involved and some of the most important open problems in the field.

title: Gravitational Waves from Disks Around Spinning Black Holes: Simulations in Full General Relativity
authors: Erik Wessel, Vasileios Paschalidis, Antonios Tsokaros, Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: We present fully general-relativistic numerical evolutions of self-gravitating tori around spinning black holes with dimensionless spin a/M=0.7 parallel or anti-parallel to the disk angular momentum. The initial disks are unstable to the hydrodynamic Papaloizou-Pringle Instability which causes them to grow persistent orbiting matter clumps. The effect of black hole spin on the growth and saturation of the instability is assessed. We find that the instability behaves similarly to prior simulations with non-spinning black holes, with a shift in frequency due to spin-induced changes in disk orbital period. Copious gravitational waves are generated by these systems, and we analyze their detectability by current and future gravitational wave observatories for large range of masses. We find that systems of 10Msun - relevant for black hole-neutron star mergers - are detectable by Cosmic Explorer out to ~300 Mpc, while DECIGO (LISA) will be able to detect systems of 1000Msun (105Msun) - relevant for disks forming in collapsing supermassive stars - out to cosmological redshift of z~5 (z~1). Computing the accretion rate of these systems we find that these systems may also be promising sources of coincident electromagnetic signals.

title: Evolution of magnetic deformation in neutron star crust
authors: Yasufumi Kojima, Shota Kisaka, Kotaro Fujisawa
topic: In this study, we examine the magnetic field evolution occurring in a neutron star crust. Beyond the elastic limit, the lattice ions are assumed to act as a plastic flow. The Ohmic dissipation, Hall drift, and bulk fluid velocity driven by the Lorentz force are considered in our numerical simulation. A magnetically induced quadrupole deformation is observed in the crust during the evolution. Generally, the ellipticity decreases as the magnetic energy decreases. In a toroidal-field-dominated model, the sign of the ellipticity changes. Namely, the initial prolate shape tends to become oblate. This occurs because the toroidal component decays rapidly on a smaller timescale than the poloidal dipole component. We find that the magnetic dipole component does not change significantly on the Hall timescale of ~1Myr for the considered simple initial models. Thus, a more complex initial model is required to study the fast decay of surface dipoles on the abovementioned timescale.

title: The Physical Mechanisms of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Bing Zhang
topic: Fast radio bursts are mysterious millisecond-duration transients prevalent in the radio sky. Rapid accumulation of data in recent years has facilitated an understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of these events. Knowledge gained from the neighboring fields of gamma-ray bursts and radio pulsars also offered insight. Here I review developments in this fast-moving field. Two generic categories of radiation model invoking either magnetospheres of compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) or relativistic shocks launched from such objects have been much debated. The recent detection of a Galactic fast radio burst in association with a soft gamma-ray repeater suggests that magnetar engines can produce at least some, and probably all, fast radio bursts. Other engines that could produce fast radio bursts are not required, but are also not impossible.

title: Relativistic effective action of dynamical gravitomagnetic tides for slowly rotating neutron stars
authors: Pawan Kumar Gupta, Jan Steinhoff, Tanja Hinderer
topic: Gravitomagnetic quasi-normal modes of neutron stars are resonantly excited by tidal effects during a binary inspiral, leading to a potentially measurable effect in the gravitational wave signal. We take an important step towards incorporating these effects in waveform models by developing a relativistic effective action for the gravitomagnetic dynamics that clarifies a number of subtleties. Working in the slow-rotation limit, we first consider the post-Newtonian approximation and explicitly derive the effective action from the equations of motion. We demonstrate that this formulation opens a novel way to compute mode frequencies, yields insights into the relevant matter variables, and elucidates the role of a shift symmetry of the fluid properties under a displacement of the gravitomagnetic mode amplitudes. We then construct a fully relativistic action based on the symmetries and a power counting scheme. This action involves four coupling coefficients that depend on the internal structure of the neutron star and characterize the key matter parameters imprinted in the gravitational waves. We show that, after fixing one of the coefficients by normalization, the other three directly involve the two kinds of gravitomagnetic Love numbers (static and irrotational), and the mode frequencies. We discuss several interesting features and dynamical consequences of this action. Our results provide the foundation for deriving precision predictions of gravitomagnetic effects, and the nuclear physics they encode, for gravitational-wave astronomy.

title: Kilonova Emission From Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers. II. Luminosity Function and Implications for Target-of-opportunity Observations of Gravitational-wave Triggers and Blind Searches
authors: Jin-Ping Zhu, Shichao Wu, Yuan-Pei Yang, Bing Zhang, He Gao, Yun-Wei Yu, Zhuo Li, Zhoujian Cao, Liang-Duan Liu, Yan Huang, Xing-Han Zhang
topic: We present detailed simulations of kilonova (KN) and GRB afterglow emission originating from BH-NS mergers. We present KN luminosity function and discuss the detectability of KN and GRB afterglow in connection with GW detections, GW-triggered ToO observations, and blind searches in time-domain survey observations. The predicted absolute magnitude of the BH-NS merger KNe at 0.5day after the merger falls in the range of [−10,−15.5]. The simulated luminosity function contains the viewing angle distribution information of the anisotropic KN emission. We simulate the GW detection rates, detectable distances and signal duration, for the future networks of 2nd, 2.5th, and 3rd generation GW detectors. BH-NS mergers produce brighter KNe and afterglows if the primary BH has a high aligned-spin, and the NS is less-massive with a stiff EoS. The detectability of KN emission is sensitive to the BH spin. If primary BHs typically have a low spin, the EM counterpart of BH-NSs are hard to discover. For the 2nd generation GW detector networks, a limiting magnitude of mlimit~23-24mag is required to detect the KNe even if BH high spin is assumed. This could provide a plausible explanation for the lack of KN detection from BH-NS candidates during O3: either there is no EM counterpart, or the current follow-up observations are too shallow. These observations may still have the chance to detect the on-axis jet afterglow associated with a sGRB or an orphan afterglow. In future GW detection eras, more remote GW signals can be detected, but their associated KNe are more difficult to detect. Follow up observations can in any case detect possible associated sGRB afterglows, from which KN signatures may be studied. For time-domain survey observations, a high-cadence search in redder filters is recommended to detect more BH-NS KNe and afterglows.

title: Some properties of doubly-degenerate stars
authors: Shin'ichirou Yoshida, Junya Tanaka
topic: We investigate critical masses of and circular geodesics around doubly-degenerate stars (DDSs) which are composed of cold nuclear matter as well as cold Fermionic dark matter (DM). We here consider asymmetric dark Fermion with self-interaction as a DM candidate. These stars have core-envelope structures and are categorized into baryon-enveloped and DM-enveloped, according to the composition of their envelope. It is seen that the baryon-enveloped and DM-enveloped classes have their own critical masses determined mainly by the dominant component in their envelope. For a typical parameter sets, we see that a balanced mixture of two species may lead to smaller masses than if the either of the species is dominant.
We also show that for a highly DM-enveloped case circular orbits in the vacuum region terminates at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) in vacuum, but circular orbits of smaller radius are possible in the DM-envelope forming a gap between the ISCO and the inner orbits.

authors: C. Ceccobello, M.H.M. Heemskerk, Y. Cavecchi, W.H.T. Vlemmings, D. Tafoya
topic: Outflows, spanning a wide range of dynamical properties and spatial extensions, have now been associated with a variety of accreting astrophysical objects, from supermassive black holes at the core of active galaxies to young stellar objects. The role of such outflows is key to the evolution of the system that generates them, for they extract a fraction of the orbiting material and angular momentum from the region close to the central object and release them in the surroundings. The details of the launching mechanism and their impact on the environment are fundamental to understand the evolution of individual sources and the similarities between different types of outflow-launching systems. We solve semi-analytically the non-relativistic, ideal, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations describing outflows launched from a rotating disk threaded with magnetic fields using our new numerical scheme. We present here a parameter study of a large sample of new solutions. We study the different combinations of forces that lead to a successfully launched jet and discuss their global properties. We show how these solutions can be applied to the outflow of the water fountain W43A for which we have observational constraints on magnetic field, density and velocity of the flow at the location of two symmetrical water maser emitting regions.

title: A backscattering dominated prompt emission model for the prompt phase of Gamma ray bursts
authors: Mukesh K Vyas, Asaf Pe'er, David Eichler
topic: As gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet drills its way through the collapsing star, it traps a baryonic cork ahead of it. Here we explore a prompt emission model for GRBs in which the jet does not cross the cork, but rather photons that are emitted deep in the flow are scattered inside the expanding cork and escape largely from the back end of it as they push it from behind. Due to the relativistic motion of the cork, these photons are easily seen by an observer close to the jet axis peaking at. We show that this model naturally explains several key observational features including: (1) Low energy spectral slope, and high energy power law index with an intermediate thermal spectral region; (2)decay of the prompt emission light curve as ; (3) Delay of soft photons; (4) peak energy - isotropic energy (the so-called Amati) correlation, with, resulting from different viewing angles. At low luminosities, our model predicts an observable turn off in the Amati relation with. (4) An anti-correlation between the spectral FWHM and time as. (5) Temporal evolution, with increase of the high energy spectral slope with time. (6) Distribution of peak energies  in the observed GRB population.

title: i-process nucleosynthesis: observational evidences from CEMP stars
authors: Partha Pratim Goswami, Aruna Goswami
topic: The surface chemical compositions of a large fraction of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, the so-called CEMP-r/s stars, are known to exhibit enhancement of both s- and r-process elements. For these stars, the heavy element abundances cannot be explained either by s-process or r-process nucleosynthesis alone, as the production sites of s- and r-process elements are very different, and these two processes produce distinct abundance patterns. Thus, the observational evidence of the double enhancement seen in CEMP-r/s stars remains a puzzle as far as the origin of the elements is concerned. In this work, we have critically analysed the observed abundances of heavy elements in a sample of eight CEMP-r/s stars from literature, to trace the origin of the observed double enhancement. Towards this, we have conducted a parametric-model based analysis to delineate the contributions of s- and r-process nucleosynthesis to the observed elemental abundances. We have further examined if the i-process (intermediate process) nucleosynthesis, that occurs at a high neutron-density (n~1015 cm-3 ) produced during proton-ingestion from a H-rich envelope to the intershell region of an AGB star, that is capable of producing both r- and s-process elements in a single stellar site, could explain the observed abundance patterns of the sample stars. Our analysis shows that the observed abundance patterns of the selected sample of CEMP-r/s stars could be fairly well reproduced using the i-process model yields.

title: Effect of hyperons on f-mode oscillations in Neutron Stars
authors: Bikram Keshari Pradhan, Debarati Chatterjee
topic: As the densities in the interior of neutron stars exceed those of terrestrial nuclear experiments, they provide a scope for studying the nature of dense matter under extreme conditions. The composition of the inner core of neutron stars is highly uncertain, and it is speculated that exotic forms of matter such as hyperons may appear there. Gravitational waves emitted by unstable oscillation modes in neutron stars contain information about their interior composition and therefore allow us to probe the interior directly. Recently, a systematic investigation of f-mode oscillations in neutron stars revealed the role of the uncertainty in nuclear saturation parameters, particularly the effective nucleon mass, on its frequency. In this work, we study the influence of the appearance of hyperons on f-mode oscillation frequencies and therefore on the emission of gravitational waves. We also speculate whether a future detection of f-mode frequencies could provide a possibility of probing the presence of hyperons in the neutron star core.

Whilst some mergers result in explosions, the survivors re-ignite helium and burn brightly for tens of thousands or millions of years. Candidate survivors include extreme helium stars, R CrB variables and various classes of helium-rich subluminous star. Nuclear waste on the survivors' surfaces provides evidence of the stars' nuclear history prior to and their nucleosynthesis during the merger. Extensive and deep spectroscopic surveys offer rich prospects for future discoveries.

authors: Shanika Galaudage, Christian Adamcewicz, Xing-Jiang Zhu, Eric Thrane
topic: Radio pulsar observations probe the lives of Galactic double neutron-star (DNS) systems while gravitational waves enable us to study extragalactic DNS in their final moments. By combining measurements from radio and gravitational-wave astronomy, we seek to gain a more complete understanding of DNS from formation to merger. We analyse the recent gravitational-wave binary neutron star mergers GW170817 and GW190425 in the context of other DNS known from radio astronomy. By employing a model for the birth and evolution of DNS, we measure the mass distribution of DNS at birth, at mid-life (in the radio), and at death (in gravitational waves). We consider the hypothesis that the high-mass gravitational-wave event GW190425 is part of a subpopulation formed through unstable case BB mass transfer, which quickly merge in ~10−100 Myr. We find mild evidence to support this hypothesis and that GW190425 is not a clear outlier from the radio population as previously claimed. If there are fast-merging binaries, we estimate that they constitute 8-79% of DNS at birth (90% credibility). We estimate the typical delay time between the birth and death of fast-merging binaries to be =5-401 Myr (90% credibility). We discuss the implications for radio and gravitational-wave astronomy.

We use equations of state (EoS) of varying stiffness provided by a parameterizable relativistic mean filed model transitioning in a first order phase transition to quark matter with a constant speed of sound. We find a strong connection between the discontinuity in energy density and the maximal mass generated by the EoS. We demonstrate, that high maximal masses cannot be realized for large discontinuities in energy density, which are necessary for visible twin stars, especially for soft EoSs. As a result twin stars and maximal masses of Mmax greater 2.2Msun are mutually exclusive.

topic: The first self-consistent simulations of electron acceleration during magnetic reconnection in a macroscale system are presented. Consistent with solar flare observations the spectra of energetic electrons take the form of power-laws that extend more than two decades in energy. The drive mechanism for these nonthermal electrons is Fermi reflection in growing and merging magnetic flux ropes. A strong guide field is found to suppress the production of nonthermal electrons by weakening the Fermi drive mechanism. For a weak guide field the total energy content of nonthermal electrons dominates that of the hot thermal electrons even though their number density remains small. Our results are benchmarked with the hard x-ray, radio and extreme ultra-violet (EUV) observations of the X8.2-class solar flare on September 10, 2017.

title: Collapsar R-Process Yields Can Reproduce [Eu/Fe] Abundance Scatter in Metal-Poor Stars
authors: Kaley Brauer, Alexander P. Ji, Maria R. Drout, Anna Frebel
topic: It is unclear if neutron star mergers can explain the observed r-process abundances of metal-poor stars. Collapsars, defined here as rotating massive stars whose collapse results in a rapidly accreting disk around a black hole that can launch jets, are a promising alternative. We find that we can produce a self-consistent model in which a population of collapsars with stochastic europium yields synthesizes all of the r-process material in metal-poor ([Fe/H] less -2.5) stars. Our model reproduces the observed scatter and evolution of scatter of [Eu/Fe] abundances. We find that if collapsars are the dominant r-process site for metal-poor stars, r-process synthesis may be linked to supernovae that produce long gamma-ray bursts. Our results also allow for the possibility that core-collapse supernovae beyond those that launch gamma-ray bursts also produce r-process material (e.g., potentially a subset of Type Ic-BL supernovae). Furthermore, we identify collapsar jet properties (isotropic energy, engine luminosity, or engine time) which may trace r-process yield and verify that the amount of r-process yield produced per collapsar in our model (~0.07 Msun) is consistent with other independent estimates. In the future, achieving 0.05 dex precision on distribution scatter or a reliable selection function would further constrain our probe of r-process production. Our model would also hold for another prompt r-process site with a power-law yield, and work is needed to determine if, for example, fast-merging neutron stars can also explain abundance scatter.

title: Non-thermal neutrinos created by shock acceleration in successful and failed core-collapse supernova
authors: Hiroki Nagakura, Kenta Hotokezaka
topic: We present a comprehensive study of neutrino shock acceleration in core-collapse supernova (CCSN). The leading players are heavy leptonic neutrinos, the former and latter potentially gain the energy up to ~100 MeV and ~200 MeV, respectively, through the shock acceleration. Demonstrating the neutrino shock acceleration by Monte Carlo neutrino transport, we make a statement that it commonly occurs in the early post bounce phase (lowere 50 ms after bounce) for all massive stellar collapse experiencing nuclear bounce and would reoccur in the late phase (after 100 ms) for failed CCSNe. This opens up a new possibility to detect high energy neutrinos by terrestrial detectors from Galactic CCSNe; hence, we estimate the event counts for Hyper(Super)-Kamiokande, DUNE, and JUNO. We find that the event count with the energy of greater 80 MeV is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the thermal neutrinos regardless of the detectors, and muon production may also happen in these detectors with the energy of greater 100 MeV. The neutrino signals provide a precious information on deciphering the inner dynamics of CCSN and placing a constraint on the physics of neutrino oscillation; indeed, the detection of the high energy neutrinos through charged current reaction channels will be a smoking gun evidence of neutrino flavor conversion.

title: Gravitational waves from mountains in newly born millisecond magnetars
authors: Ankan Sur, Brynmor Haskell
topic: In this paper we study the spin-evolution and gravitational-wave luminosity of a newly born millisecond magnetar, formed either after the collapse of a massive star or after the merger of two neutron stars. In both cases we consider the effect of fallback accretion, and consider the evolution of the system due to the different torques acting on the star, namely the spin up torque due to accretion and spin-down torques due to magnetic dipole radiation, neutrino emission, and gravitational wave emission linked to the formation of a `mountain' on the accretion poles. Initially the spin period is mostly affected by the dipole radiation, but at later times accretion spin the star up rapidly. We find that a magnetar formed after the collapse of a massive star can accrete up to 1 Msun , and survive on the order of 50 s before collapsing to a black hole. The gravitational wave strain, for an object located at 1 Mpc, is hc 10^{-23} at kHz frequencies, making this a potential target for next generation ground based detectors. A magnetar formed after a binary neutron star merger, on the other hand, accretes at the most 0.2 Msun, and emits gravitational waves with a lower maximum strain of the order of hc 10^{-24} , but also survives for much longer times, and may possibly be associated with the X-ray plateau observed in the light curve of a number of short gamma-ray burst.

authors: Alexander Y. Chen, Yajie Yuan, Andrei M. Beloborodov, Xinyu Li
topic: Instabilities in a neutron star can generate Alfven waves in its magnetosphere. Propagation along the curved magnetic field lines strongly shears the wave, boosting its electric current jA. We derive an analytic expression for the evolution of the wave vector k and the growth of jA. In the strongly sheared regime, jA may exceed the maximum current j0 that can be supported by the background electron-positron plasma. We investigate these "charge-starved" waves, first using a simplified two-fluid analytic model, then with first-principles kinetic simulations. We find that the Alfven wave continues to propagate successfully even when κ=jA/j0 gg 1. It sustains jA by compressing and advecting the plasma along the magnetic field lines with particle Lorentz factors ~κ1/2. The simulations show how plasma instabilities lead to gradual dissipation of the wave energy, giving a dissipation power Ldiss~1035(κ/100)1/2(Bw/1011G)erg/s, where Bw is the wave amplitude. Our results imply that dissipation due to charge starvation is not sufficient to power observed fast radio bursts (FRBs), in contrast to recent proposals.

title: Eccentricity evolution of compact binaries and applications to gravitational-wave physics
authors: Vitor Cardoso, Caio F. B. Macedo, Rodrigo Vicente
topic: Searches for gravitational waves from compact binaries focus mostly on quasi-circular motion, with the rationale that wave emission circularizes the orbit. Here, we study the generality of this result, when astrophysical environments (e.g., accretion disks) or other fundamental interactions are taken into account. We are motivated by possible electromagnetic counterparts to binary black hole coalescences and orbits, but also by the possible use of eccentricity as a smoking-gun for new physics. We find that: i) backreaction from radiative mechanisms, including scalars, vectors and gravitational waves circularize the orbital motion. ii) by contrast, environmental effects such as accretion and dynamical friction increase the eccentricity of binaries. Thus, it is the competition between radiative mechanisms and environmental effects that dictates the eccentricity evolution. We study this competition within an adiabatic approach, including gravitational radiation and dynamical friction forces. We show that that there is a critical semi-major axis below which gravitational radiation dominates the motion and the eccentricity of the system decreases. However, the eccentricity inherited from the environment-dominated stage can be substantial, and in particular can affect LISA sources. We provide examples for GW190521-like sources.

title: On the Torque Reversals of Accreting Neutron Stars
authors: Unal Ertan
topic: We have extended the analytical model proposed earlier to estimate the inner disk radius of accreting neutron stars in the strong-propeller (SP) phase, and the conditions for the transitions between the strong and weak propeller (WP) phases (Ertan 2017, 2018) to the WP (accretion with spin-down) and the spin-up (SU) phases, and the torque reversals during the WP/SU transitions. The model can account for some basic observed properties of these systems that are not expected in conventional models: (1) accretion on to the star at low X-ray luminosities and the transitions to the SP phase (no accretion) at critical accretion rates much lower than the rate required for the spin-up/spin-down transition, (2) ongoing accretion throughout a large range of accretion rates while the source is spinning down (WP phase), and (3) transitions between the spin-up and spin-down phases with comparable torque magnitudes, without substantial changes in the mass-flow rate. Our results indicate that the magnitudes of the torques on either side of the torque reversal have a ratio similar for different systems independently of their spin periods, magnetic dipole moments and accretion rates during the transitions. Estimated torque reversal properties in our model are in agreement with the observed torque reversals of 4U 1626--67.

title: Urca Nuclide Production in Type-I X-ray Bursts and Implications for Nuclear Physics Studies
authors: Grant Merz, Zach Meisel
topic: The thermal structure of accreting neutron stars is affected by the presence of urca nuclei in the neutron star crust. Nuclear isobars harboring urca nuclides can be produced in the ashes of Type I X-ray bursts, but the details of their production have not yet been explored. Using the code {\tt MESA}, we investigate urca nuclide production in a one-dimensional model of Type I X-ray bursts using astrophysical conditions thought to resemble the source GS 1826-24. We find that high-mass (A geq 55) urca nuclei are primarily produced late in the X-ray burst, during hydrogen-burning freeze-out that corresponds to the tail of the burst light curve. The ~0.4--0.6~GK temperature relevant for nucleosynthesis of these urca nuclides is much lower than the ~1~GK temperature most relevant for X-ray burst light curve impacts by nuclear reaction rates involving high-mass nuclides. The latter temperature is often assumed for nuclear physics studies. Therefore, our findings alter the excitation energy range of interest in compound nuclei for nuclear physics studies of urca nuclide production. We demonstrate that for some cases this will need to be considered in planning for nuclear physics experiments. Additionally, we show that the lower temperature range for urca nuclide production explains why variations of some nuclear reaction rates in model calculations impacts the burst light curve but not local features of the burst ashes.

title: Nucleosynthesis imprints from different Type Ia Supernova explosion scenarios and implications for galactic chemical evolution
authors: F. Lach, F. K. Roepke, I. R. Seitenzahl, B. Coté , S. Gronow, A. J. Ruiter 
topic: We analyze the nucleosynthesis yields of various Type Ia supernova explosion simulations including pure detonations in sub- Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, double detonations and pure helium detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs with an accreted helium envelope, a violent merger model of two white dwarfs and deflagrations as well as delayed detonations in Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. We focus on the iron peak elements Mn, Zn and Cu. To this end, we also briefly review the different burning regimes and production sites of these elements as well as the results of abundance measurements and several galactic chemical evolution studies. We find that super-solar values of [Mn/Fe] are not restricted to Chandrasekhar mass explosion models. Scenarios including a helium detonation can significantly contribute to the production of Mn, in particular the models proposed for calcium-rich transients. Although Type Ia supernovae are often not accounted for as production sites of Zn and Cu, our models involving helium shell detonations can produce these elements in super-solar ratios relative to Fe. Our results suggest a re-consideration of Type Ia supernova yields in galactic chemical evolution models. A detailed comparison with observations can provide new insight into the progenitor and explosion channels of these events.

title: Analytical Solution of Magnetically Dominated Astrophysical Jets/Winds
authors: Liang Chen, Bing Zhang
topic: We present an analytical solution of a highly magnetized jet/wind flow. The left-hand of the general force-free jet/wind equation (the "pulsar" equation) is separated into a rotating and a non-rotating term. The two equations with either term can be solved analytically and the two solutions match each other very well. Therefore, we obtain a general approximate solution of a magnetically dominated jet/wind, which covers from the non-relativistic to relativistic regimes, with the drift velocity well matching the cold plasma velocity. The acceleration of a jet includes three stages. 1. The jet flow is located within the Alfven critical surface (i.e. the light cylinder), has a non-relativistic speed, and is dominated by toroidal motion. 2. The jet is beyond the Alfven critical surface where the flow is dominated by poloidal motion and becomes relativistic. The total velocity in these two stages follows the same law vGamma=OmegaR. 3. The evolution law is replaced by vGammaΓ = 1/(Theta sqrt(2-nu)), where Theta is the half opening angle of the jet and Theta less nu less 2 is a free parameter determined by the magnetic field configuration. This is because the earlier efficient acceleration finally breaks the causality connection between different parts in the jet, preventing a global solution. The jet has to carry local charges and currents to support an electromagnetic balance. This approximate solution is consistent with known theoretical results and numerical simulations and it is more convenient to directly compare with observations. This theory may be used to constrain the spin of black holes in astrophysical jets.

title: How are gamma-ray burst radio afterglows populated?
authors: K.Zhang, Z.B.Zhang, Y.F.Huang, L.M.Song, S.J.Zheng, X.J.Li
topic: We systematically analyze three GRB samples named as radio-loud, radio-quiet and radio-none afterglows, respectively. It is shown that dichotomy of the radio-loud afterglows is not necessary. Interestingly, we find that the intrinsic durations (Tint), isotropic energies of prompt gamma-rays (Egamma,iso) and redshifts (z) of their host galaxies are log-normally distributed for both the radio-loud and radio-quiet samples except those GRBs without any radio detections. Based on the distinct distributions of Tint, Egamma,iso, the circum-burst medium density (n) and the isotropic equivalent energy of radio afterglows (Lnu,p), we confirm that the GRB radio afterglows are really better to be divided into the dim and the bright types. However, it is noticeable that the distributions of flux densities (Fhost) from host galaxies of both classes of radio afterglows are intrinsically quite similar. Meanwhile, we point out that the radio-none sample is also obviously different from the above two samples with radio afterglows observed, according to the cumulative frequency distributions of the Tint and the Egamma,iso, together with correlations between Tint and z. In addition, a positive correlation between Egamma,iso and Lnu,p is found in the radio-loud samples especially for the supernova-associated GRBs. Besides, we also find this positive correlation in the radio-quiet sample. A negative correlation between Tint and z is confirmed to hold for the radio-quiet sample too. The dividing line between short and long GRBs in the rest frame is at Tint=1 s. Consequently, we propose that the radio-loud, the radio-quiet and the radio-none GRBs could be originated from different progenitors.

title: Afterglow Synchrotron Radiations follow the Lp,iso-Ep,z-Gamma0 relation of Gamma-Ray Bursts? Cases of GRBs 190114C, 130427A, and 180720B
authors: Xiao-Li Huang (NJU), En-Wei Liang (GXU), Ruo-Yu Liu (NJU), Ji-Gui Cheng (GXU), Xiang-Yu Wang (NJU)
topic: Bimodal spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow of GRBs 190114C, 130427A and 180720B confirm that they are originated from the synchrotron emission (Syn) and synchrotron self-Compton Scattering process (SSC) of electrons accelerated in the jets. The radiation mechanism and the physics of the observed spectrum-luminosity/energy relations of GRBs remain as open questions. By extracting the Syn component through fitting their early afterglow SEDs with the Syn+SSC model, we find that their luminosity (Lsyn), peak energy (Ep,syn,z), and the Lorentz factor of the afterglow fireball (Gammat) follow the Lp,iso-Ep,z-Gamma0 relation of prompt gamma-rays, where Lp,iso is the isotropic luminosity, Ep,z is the peak energy of the νfν spectrum in the burst frame, and Γ0 is the initial Lorentz factor of the fireball. To examine whether late afterglows is consistent with this relation, we calculate the synchrotron component at late afterglows. It is found that they also follow the same Lp,iso-Ep,z-Gamma0 relation, albeit they are not consistent with the Lp,iso-Ep,z relation. Our results may imply that the Lp,iso-Ep,z-Gamma0 would be an universal feature of synchrotron radiations of electrons accelerated in GRB jets throughout the prompt and afterglow phases among GRBs. Its origin is not fully understood and possible explanations are briefly discussed.

title: GW190521 may be an intermediate mass ratio inspiral
authors: Alexander H. Nitz, Collin D. Capano
topic: GW190521 is the first confident observation of a binary black hole merger with total mass M greater 100Msun. Given the lack of observational constraints at these masses, we analyze GW190521 considering two different priors for the binary's masses: uniform in mass ratio and source-frame total mass, and uniform in source-frame component masses. For the uniform in mass-ratio prior, we find that the component masses are msrc1=168+15-61Msun and msrc2=16+33-3Msun. The uniform in component-mass prior yields a bimodal posterior distribution. There is a low-mass-ratio mode (q less 4) with msrc1=100+17−18Msun and msrc2=57+17−16Msun and a high-mass-ratio mode (q greter 4) with msrc1=166+16-35Msun and msrc2=16+14-3Msun. Although the two modes have nearly equal posterior probability, the maximum-likelihood parameters are in the high-mass ratio mode, with msrc1=171Msun and msrc2=16Msun, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 16. These results are consistent with the proposed "mass gap" produced by pair-instability in supernova. Our results are inconsistent with those published in Abbott et al. (2020b). We find that a combination of the prior used and the constraints applied may have prevented that analysis from sampling the high-mass-ratio mode. An accretion flare in AGN J124942.3+344929 was observed in possible coincidence with GW190521 by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We report parameters assuming a common origin; however, the spatial agreement of GW190521 and the EM flare alone does not provide convincing evidence for the association

title: Shedding light on the angular momentum evolution of binary neutron star merger remnants: a semi-analytic model
authors: Matteo Lucca, Laura Sagunski, Federico Guercilena, Christian M. Fromm
topic: The main features of the gravitational dynamics of binary neutron star systems are now well established. While the inspiral can be precisely described in the post-Newtonian approximation, fully relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations are required to model the evolution of the merger and post-merger phase. However, the interpretation of the numerical results can often be non-trivial, so that toy models become a very powerful tool. Not only do they simplify the interpretation of the post-merger dynamics, but also allow to gain insights into the physics behind it. In this work, we construct a simple toy model that is capable of reproducing the whole angular momentum evolution of the post-merger remnant, from the merger to the collapse. We validate the model against several fully general-relativistic numerical simulations employing a genetic algorithm, and against additional constraints derived from the spectral properties of the gravitational radiation. As a result, from the remarkably close overlap between the model predictions and the reference simulations within the first milliseconds after the merger, we are able to systematically shed light on the currently open debate regarding the source of the low-frequency peaks of the gravitational wave power spectral density. Additionally, we also present two original relations connecting the angular momentum of the post-merger remnant at merger and collapse to initial properties of the system.

title: Electromagnetic Emission from a Binary Black Hole Merger Remnant in Plasma: Field Alignment and Plasma Temperature
authors: Bernard J. Kelly, Zachariah B. Eteinne, Jacob Golomb, Jeremy D. Schnittman, John G. Baker, Scott C. Noble, Geoffrey Ryan
topic: Comparable-mass black-hole mergers generically result in moderate to highly spinning holes, whose spacetime curvature will significantly affect nearby matter in observable ways. We investigate how the moderate spin of a post-merger Kerr black hole immersed in a plasma with initially uniform density and uniform magnetic field affects potentially observable accretion rates and energy fluxes. Varying the initial specific internal energy of the plasma over two decades, we find very little change in steady-state mass accretion rate or Poynting luminosity, except at the lowest internal energies, where fluxes do not exhibit steady-state behavior during the simulation timescale. Fixing the internal energy and varying the initial fixed magnetic-field amplitude and orientation, we find that the steady-state Poynting luminosity depends strongly on the initial field angle with respect to the black hole spin axis, while the matter accretion rate is more stable until the field angle exceeds $\sim 45\degree$. The proto-jet formed along the black hole spin-axis conforms to a thin, elongated cylinder near the hole, while aligning with the asymptotic magnetic field at large distances.

title: The impact of magnetic fields on momentum transport and saturation of shear-flow instability by stable modes
authors: A. E. Fraser, P. W. Terry, E. G. Zweibel, M. J. Pueschel, J. M. Schroeder
topic: The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability of a shear layer with an initially-uniform magnetic field in the direction of flow is studied in the framework of 2D incompressible magnetohydrodynamics with finite resistivity and viscosity using direct numerical simulations. The shear layer evolves freely, with no external forcing, and thus broadens in time as turbulent stresses transport momentum across it. As with KH-unstable flows in hydrodynamics, the instability here features a conjugate stable mode for every unstable mode in the absence of dissipation. Stable modes are shown to transport momentum up its gradient, shrinking the layer width whenever they exceed unstable modes in amplitude. In simulations with weak magnetic fields, the linear instability is minimally affected by the magnetic field, but enhanced small-scale fluctuations relative to the hydrodynamic case are observed. These enhanced fluctuations coincide with increased energy dissipation and faster layer broadening, with these features more pronounced in simulations with stronger fields. These trends result from the magnetic field reducing the effects of stable modes relative to the transfer of energy to small scales. As field strength increases, stable modes become less excited and thus transport less momentum against its gradient. Furthermore, the energy that would otherwise transfer back to the driving shear due to stable modes is instead allowed to cascade to small scales, where it is lost to dissipation. Approximations of the turbulent state in terms of a reduced set of modes are explored. While the Reynolds stress is well-described using just two modes per wavenumber at large scales, the Maxwell stress is not.

title: Modelling Type Ic Supernovae with TARDIS: Hidden Helium in SN1994I?
authors: Marc Williamson, Wolfgang Kerzendorf, Maryam Modjaz
topic: Supernovae (SNe) with photospheric spectra devoid of Hydrogen and Helium features are generally classified as Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic). However, there is ongoing debate as to whether Helium can be hidden in the ejecta of SNe Ic (that is, Helium is present in the ejecta, but produces no obvious features in the spectra). We present the first application of the fast, 1-D radiative transfer code TARDIS to a SN Ic, and we investigate the question of how much Helium can be hidden in the outer layers of the SN Ic ejecta. We generate TARDIS models for the nearby, well-observed, and extensively modeled SN Ic 1994I, and we perform a code comparison to a different, well-established Monte Carlo based radiation transfer code. The code comparison shows that TARDIS produces consistent synthetic spectra for identical ejecta models of SN1994I. In addition, we perform a systematic experiment of adding outer He shells of varying masses to our SN1994I models. We find that an outer He shell of only 0.05Msun produces strong optical and NIR He spectral features for SN1994I which are not present in observations, thus indicating that the SN1994I ejecta is almost fully He deficient compared to the He masses of typical He-rich SN progenitors. Finally we show that the He I lambda20851 line pseudo equivalent width of our modeled spectra for SN1994I could be used to infer the outer He shell mass which suggests that NIR spectral follow-up of SNe Ic will be critical for addressing the hidden helium question for a statistical sample of SNe Ic.

title: Spherical shocks in a steep density gradient of expanding media
authors: Taya Govreen-Segal, Ehud Nakar, Amir Levinson
topic: We study the propagation of a Newtonian shock in a spherically symmetric, homologously expanding ejecta. We focus on media with a steep power-law density profile of the form rho propto t-3v−a, with a>5, where v is the velocity of the expanding medium and t is time. Such profiles are expected in the leading edge of supernovae ejecta and sub-relativistic outflows from binary neutron star mergers. We find that such shocks always accelerate in the observer frame and lose causal contact with the bulk of the driver gas, owing to the steep density profile. However, the prolonged shock evolution exhibits two distinct pathways: In one, the shock strength diminishes with time until the shock eventually dies out. In the other, the shock strength steadily increases, and the solution approaches the self-similar solution of a shock is a static medium. By mapping the parameter space of shock solutions, we find that the evolutionary pathways are dictated by α and by the initial ratio between the shock velocity and the local upstream velocity. We find that for a less omega c (omega c = 8), the shock always decays, and that for α>ωc the shock may decay or grow stronger depending on the initial value of the velocity ratio. These two branches bifurcate from a self-similar solution derived analytically for a constant velocity ratio. We analyze properties of the solutions that may have an impact on the observational signatures of such systems, and assess the conditions required for decaying shocks to break out from a finite medium.

title: Dispersion and Rotation Measures from the Ejecta of Compact Binary Mergers: Clue to the Progenitors of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Z. Y. Zhao, G. Q. Zhang, Y. Y. Wang, F. Y. Wang (NJU)
topic: Magnetars are promising central engines of fast radio bursts (FRBs), since the discovery of FRB 200428 from the Galactic SGR 1935+2154. It is widely believed that magnetars could form by core-collapse (CC) explosions and compact binary mergers, such as binary neutron star (BNS), binary white dwarfs (BWD) and neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) mergers. Therefore, it is particularly important to distinguish the various progenitors of FRBs. The expansion of the merger ejecta produces a time-evolving dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) that can probe the local environments of FRBs. In this paper, we derive the scaling laws for the DM and RM from ejecta with different dynamical structures (the mass and energy distribution) in the uniform ambient medium (merger scenario) and wind environment (CC scenario). We find that the DM and RM will increase in early phase, while DM will continue to grow slowly but RM will decrease in later phase in merger scenario. We also fit the DM and RM evolution of FRB 121102 simultaneously in BNS merger scenario, and find that the source age is ~10 yr when it was first detected in 2012, and the ambient medium density is ~2.3 cm-3. The large offsets of some FRBs are consistent with BNS/NSWD channel. The population synthesis method is used to estimate the rate of compact binary mergers. The rate of BWD mergers is close to the observed FRB rate. Therefore, the progenitors of FRBs may not be unique.

authors: J. Heinzel, M. W. Coughlin, T. Dietrich, M. Bulla, S. Antier, N. Christensen, D. A. Coulter, R. J. Foley, L. Issa, N. Khetan
topic: The detection of AT2017gfo proved that binary neutron star mergers are progenitors of kilonovae. Using a combination of numerical-relativity and radiative-transfer simulations, the community has developed sophisticated models for these transients for a wide portion of the expected parameter space. Using these simulations and surrogate models made from them, it has been possible to perform Bayesian inference of the observed signals to infer properties of the ejected matter. It has been pointed out that combining inclination constraints derived from the kilonova with gravitational-wave measurements increases the accuracy with which binary parameters can be measured and allows a more accurate inference of the Hubble Constant. In order to not introduce biases, constraints on the inclination angle for AT2017gfo should be insensitive to the employed models. In this work, we compare different assumptions about the ejecta and radiative reprocesses used by the community and we investigate their impact on the parameter inference. While most inferred parameters agree, we find disagreement between posteriors for the inclination angle for different geometries that have been used in the literature. According to our study, the inclusion of reprocessing of the photons between different ejecta types improves the modeling fits to AT2017gfo and in some cases affects the inferred constraints. Our study motivates the inclusion of large ~ 1 mag uncertainties in the kilonova models employed for Bayesian analysis to capture yet unknown systematics, especially when inferring inclination angles, although smaller uncertainties seem appropriate to capture model systematics for other parameters. We also use this method to impose soft constraints on the ejecta geometry of the kilonova AT2017gfo.

title: Ambipolar diffusion velocity and magnetic field evolution in the neutron star core
authors: Monika Sinha
topic: The magnetic field associated with neutron stars are generally believed to be threaded inside the star. In presence of magnetic field the plasma present in the interior of the star goes under several processes which lead to magnetic field evolution. It is thought that magnetar activities are mainly due to field decay. The most important process of field decay inside the core of the star is the ambipolar diffusion of the charged particles present in the interior plasma. The decay rate due to ambipolar diffusion is directly connected to the ambipolar velocity of the charged particles under the influence of present magnetic field. The ambipolar velocity of the charged particles depends on the internal dynamics of the particles. We outline a general method to solve the particle dynamics in presence of magnetic field to have a magneto-hydrodynamic equation form ambipolar velocity. The equation is general and applicable to all possible surrounding conditions e.g. temperature,matter states like normal or superfluid etc.

topic: We develop a neutrino transfer code for core-collapse simulations, that directly solves the multidimensional Boltzmann equations in full general relativity. We employ the discrete ordinate method, which discretizes the six dimensional phase space. The code is an extension of our special relativistic code coupled to a Newtonian hydrodynamics code, which is currently employed for core-collapse supernova simulations. In order to demonstrate our code's capability to treat general relativistic effects, we conduct some tests: we first compute the free streaming of neutrinos in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes and compare the results with the geodesic curves; in the Schwarzschild case we deploy not only a 1-dimensional grid in space under spherical symmetry but also a 2-dimensional spatial mesh under axisymmetry in order to assess the capability of the code to compute the spatial advection of neutrinos; secondly, we calculate the neutrino transport in a fixed matter background, which is taken from a core-collapse supernova simulation with our general relativistic but spherically symmetric Boltzmann-hydrodynamics code, to obtain a steady neutrino distribution; the results are compared with those given by the latter code.

authors: Kohsuke Sumiyoshi, Sho Fujibayashi, Yuichiro Sekiguchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: We study properties of neutrino transfer in a remnant of neutron star merger, consisting of a massive neutron star and a surrounding torus. We perform numerical simulations of the neutrino transfer by solving the Boltzmann equation with momentum-space angles and energies of neutrinos for snapshots of the merger remnant having elongated shapes. The evaluation of the neutrino distributions in the multi-dimensions enable us to provide the detailed information of angle and energy spectra and neutrino reaction rates. We demonstrate features of asymmetric neutrino fluxes from the deformed remnant and investigate the neutrino emission region by determining the neutrinosphere for each energy. We examine the emission and absorption of neutrinos to identify important ingredients of heating rates through neutrino irradiation. We show that the contributions of μ- and τ-types neutrinos are important for the heating in the region above the massive neutron star. We also examine the angle moments and the Eddington tensor calculated directly by the neutrino distribution functions and compare them with those obtained by a moment closure approach, which is often used in the study of neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics. We show that the components of the Eddington tensor have non-monotonic behaviors and the approximation of the closure relation may become inaccurate for high energy neutrinos, whose fluxes are highly aspherical due to the extended merger remnant.

title: Temporal Properties of Precursors, Main peaks and Extended Emissions of Short GRBs in the Third Swift/BAT GRB Catalog
authors: X. J. Li, Z. B. Zhang, X. L. Zhang, H. Y. Zhen
topic: A comprehensive study is given to short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in the third Swift/BAT GRB Catalog from December 2004 to July 2019. We examine in details the temporal properties of the three components in the prompt gamma-ray emission phase, including precursors, main peaks and extended emissions (EE). We investigate the similarity of the main peaks between one-component and two-component sGRBs. It is found that there is no substantial difference among their main peaks. Importantly, comparisons are made between in the single-peaked sGRBs and the double-peaked sGRBs. It is found that our results of main peaks in Swift/BAT sGRBs are essentially consistent with those in CGRO/BATSE ones recently found in our paper I. Interestingly, we suspect, besides the newly-found MODE I/II evolution forms of pulses in BATSE sGRBs in paper I, that there would have more evolution modes of pulses across differently adjacent energy channels in view of the Swift/BAT observations. We further inspect the correlation of the main peaks with either the precursors or the EEs. We find that the main peaks tend to last longer than the precursors but shorter than the EEs. In particular, we verify the power-law correlations related with peak fluxes of the three components, strongly suggesting that they are produced from the similar central engine activities. Especially, we compare the temporal properties of GRB 170817A with other sGRBs with EE and find no obvious differences between them.

title: Kilonovae across the nuclear physics landscape: The impact of nuclear physics uncertainties on r-process-powered emission
authors: Jennifer Barnes, Y. L. Zhu, K. A. Lund, T. M. Sprouse, N. Vassh, G. C. McLaughlin, M.R. Mumpower, R. Surman
topic: Merging neutron stars produce "kilonovae"---electromagnetic transients powered by the decay of unstable nuclei synthesized via rapid neutron capture (the r-process) in material that is gravitationally unbound during inspiral and coalescence. Kilonova emission, if accurately interpreted, can be used to characterize the masses and compositions of merger-driven outflows, helping to resolve a long-standing debate about the origins of r-process material in the Universe. We explore how the uncertain properties of nuclei involved in the r-process complicate the inference of outflow properties from kilonova observations. Using r-process simulations, we show how nuclear physics uncertainties impact predictions of radioactive heating and element synthesis. For a set of models that span a large range in both predicted heating and final abundances, we carry out detailed numerical calculations of decay product thermalization and radiation transport in a kilonova ejecta with a fixed mass and density profile. The light curves associated with our models exhibit great diversity in their luminosities, with peak brightness varying by more than an order of magnitude. We also find variability in the shape of the kilonova light curves and their color, which in some cases runs counter to the expectation that increasing levels of lanthanide and/or actinide enrichment will be correlated with longer, dimmer, redder emission.

title: A unified accreting magnetar model for long-duration gamma-ray bursts and some stripped-envelope supernovae
authors: W. L. Lin, X. F. Wang, L. J. Wang, Z. G. Dai
topic: Both the long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and the Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe~I) have been proposed to be primarily powered by central magnetars. A correlation, proposed between the initial spin period (P0) and the surface magnetic field (B) of the magnetars powering the X-ray plateaus in LGRB afterglows, indicates a possibility that the magnetars have reached an equilibrium spin period due to the fallback accretion. For the SLSNe~I and a fraction of engine-powered normal type Ic supernovae (SNe~Ic) and broad-lined subclass (SNe~Ic-BL), the magnetars could also reach an accretion-induced spin equilibrium, but the corresponding B-P0 distribution suggests a different accretion rate range. Considering the effect of fallback accretion, magnetars with relatively weak fields are responsible for the SLSNe~I, while those with stronger magnetic fields could lead to SNe~Ic/Ic-BL. Some SLSNe~I in our sample could arise from compact progenitor stars, while others that require longer-term accretion may originate from the progenitor stars with more extended envelopes or circumstellar medium.

title: On the deceleration of Fanaroff-Riley Class I jets: mass loading of magnetized jets by stellar winds
authors: Andreu Anglés-Castillo, Manel Perucho, José María Martí, Robert A. Laing
topic: In this paper we present steady-state RMHD simulations that include a mass-load term to study the process of jet deceleration. The mass-load mimics the injection of a proton-electron plasma from stellar winds within the host galaxy into initially pair plasma jets. The spatial jet evolution covers ~500pc from jet injection in the grid at 10~pc from the jet nozzle. Our simulations use a relativistic gas equation of state and a pressure profile for the ambient medium. We compare these simulations with previous dynamical simulations of relativistic, non-magnetised jets. Our results show that toroidal magnetic fields can prevent fast jet expansion and the subsequent embedding of further stars via magnetic tension. In this sense, magnetic fields avoid a runaway deceleration process. Furthermore, when the mass-load is large enough to increase the jet density and produce fast, differential jet expansion, the conversion of magnetic energy flux into kinetic energy flux (i.e., magnetic acceleration), helps to delay the deceleration process with respect to non-magnetised jets. We conclude that the typical stellar population in elliptical galaxies cannot explain jet deceleration in classical FRI radio galaxies. However, we observe a significant change in the jet composition, thermodynamical parameters and energy dissipation along its evolution, even for moderate values of the mass-load.

title: Sleeping beasts: strong toroidal magnetic field in quiescent magnetars explains their large pulsed fraction
authors: Andrei P. Igoshev, Rainer Hollerbach, Toby Wood, Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos
topic: Magnetars are neutron stars (NSs) with extreme magnetic fields of strength 5x1013 - 1015 G. They exhibit transient, highly energetic events, such as short X-ray flashes, bursts and giant flares, all of which are powered by their enormous magnetic energy. Quiescent magnetars have X-ray luminosities between 1029 and 1035 erg/s, and are further classified as either persistent or transient magnetars. Their X-ray emission is modulated with the rotational period of the NS, with a typical relative amplitude (so-called pulsed fraction) between 10-58 per cent, implying that the surface temperature is significantly non-uniform despite the high thermal conductivity of the star's crust. Here, we present the first 3D magneto-thermal MHD simulations of magnetars with strong toroidal magnetic fields. We show that these models, combined with ray propagation in curved space-time, accurately describe the light-curves of most transient magnetars in quiescence and allow us to further constrain their rotational orientation. We find that the presence of a strong toroidal magnetic field explains the observed asymmetry in the surface temperature, and is the main cause of the strong modulation of thermal X-ray emission in quiescence.

title: Are there radio-loud and radio-quiet Gamma-Ray Bursts?
authors: Joshua Alexander Osborne, Fatemeh Bagheri, Amir Shahmoradi
topic: The potential existence of two separate classes of Long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with and without radio afterglow emission, corresponding to radio-bright/loud and radio-dark/quiet populations, has been recently argued and favored in the GRB literature. The radio-quiet LGRBs have been found to have, on average, lower total isotropic gamma-ray emissions (Eiso) and shorter intrinsic prompt gamma-ray duration (e.g., T90z). In addition, a redshift-T90z anti-correlation has been discovered among the radio-loud LGRBs, which is reportedly missing in the radio-quiet class.
Here we discuss the significance of the differences between the energetics and temporal properties of the two proposed classes of radio-loud and radio-quiet LGRBs. We show that much of the proposed evidence in support of the two distinct radio populations of LGRBs can be explained away in terms of selection effects and sample incompleteness. Our arguments are based on the recent discovery of the relatively-strong highly-significant positive correlation between the total isotropic emission (Eiso) and the intrinsic prompt duration (T90z) that is present in both populations of short-hard and long-soft GRBs, predicted, quantified, and reported for the first time by Shahmoradi (2013) and Shahmoradi and Nemiroff (2015).

authors: Lorenzo Nativi (1), Mattia Bulla (2), Stephan Rosswog (1), Christoffer Lundman (1), Grzegorz Kowal (3), Davide Gizzi (1), Gavin Paul Lamb (4), Albino Perego 
topic: Neutron star mergers eject neutron-rich matter in which heavy elements are synthesised. The decay of these freshly synthesised elements powers electromagnetic transients ("macronovae" or "kilonovae") whose luminosity and colour strongly depend on their nuclear composition. If the ejecta are very neutron-rich (electron fraction Ye less 0.25), they contain fair amounts of lanthanides and actinides which have large opacities and therefore efficiently trap the radiation inside the ejecta so that the emission peaks in the red part of the spectrum. Even small amounts of this high-opacity material can obscure emission from lower lying material and therefore act as a "lanthanide curtain". Here, we investigate how a relativistic jet that punches through the ejecta can potentially push away a significant fraction of the high opacity material before the macronova begins to shine. We use the results of detailed neutrino-driven wind studies as initial conditions and explore with 3D special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations how jets are propagating through these winds. Subsequently, we perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations to explore the resulting macronova emission. We find that the hole punched by the jet makes the macronova brighter and bluer for on-axis observers during the first few days of emission, and that more powerful jets have larger impacts on the macronova.

title: Physical, numerical, and computational challenges of modeling neutrino transport in core-collapse supernovae
authors: Anthony Mezzacappa, Eirik Endeve, O.E. Bronson Messer, Stephen W. Bruenn
topic: The proposal that core collapse supernovae are neutrino driven is still the subject of active investigation more than fifty years after the seminal paper by Colgate and White. The modern version of this paradigm, which we owe to Wilson, proposes that the supernova shock wave is powered by neutrino heating, mediated by the absorption of electron-flavor neutrinos and antineutrinos emanating from the proto-neutron star surface, or neutrinosphere. Neutrino weak interactions with the stellar core fluid, the theory of which is still evolving, are flavor and energy dependent. The associated neutrino mean free paths extend over many orders of magnitude and are never always small relative to the stellar core radius. Thus, neutrinos are never always fluid like. Instead, a kinetic description of them in terms of distribution functions that determine the number density of neutrinos in the six-dimensional phase space of position, direction, and energy, for both neutrinos and antineutrinos of each flavor, or in terms of angular moments of these neutrino distributions that instead provide neutrino number densities in the four-dimensional phase-space subspace of position and energy, is needed. In turn, the computational challenge is twofold: (i) to map the kinetic equations governing the evolution of these distributions or moments onto discrete representations that are stable, accurate, and, perhaps most important, respect physical laws such as conservation of lepton number and energy and the Fermi--Dirac nature of neutrinos and (ii) to develop efficient, supercomputer-architecture-aware solution methods for the resultant nonlinear algebraic equations. In this review, we present the current state of the art in attempts to meet this challenge

title: Shock-powered radio precursors of neutron star mergers from accelerating relativistic binary winds
authors: Navin Sridhar (1), Jonathan Zrake (1 and 2), Brian D. Metzger (1 and 3), Lorenzo Sironi (1), Dimitrios Giannios
topic: During the final stages of a compact object merger, if at least one of the binary components is a magnetized neutron star (NS), then the orbital motion of the conducting companion induces a strong current along the magnetic field lines connecting the stars. This interaction also substantially expands the NS's open magnetic flux---and hence increases its wind luminosity---relative to that of an isolated pulsar. As the binary orbit shrinks due to gravitational radiation, the power and speed of this binary-induced inspiral wind may (depending on pair loading) secularly increase, leading to self-interaction and internal shocks in the outflow beyond the binary orbit. The magnetized forward shock can generate coherent radio emission via the synchrotron maser process, resulting in an observable radio precursor to binary NS merger. We perform 1D relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of shock interaction in the accelerating binary NS wind, assuming that the inspiral wind efficiently converts its Poynting flux into bulk kinetic energy prior to the shock radius. This is combined with the shock maser spectrum from particle-in-cell simulations, to generate synthetic radio light curves. The precursor burst with a fluence of ~1 Jy ms at ~GHz frequencies lasts ~1-500 ms following the merger for a source at ~3 Gpc (Bd/1012 G)8/9, where Bd is the dipole field strength of the more strongly-magnetized star. Given an outflow geometry concentrated along the binary equatorial, the signal may be preferentially observable for high-inclination systems, i.e. those least likely to produce a detectable gamma-ray burst.

topic: With the computational power and algorithmic improvements available today, the ongoing STAR/RHIC and HADES/GSI experiments, the future FAIR and NICA facilities becoming operational, and the new precise measurements from NICER and LIGO/VIRGO, the high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics communities are in the unique position to set very stringent constraints on the equation of state of strongly interacting matter. We review the state-of-the-art of different approaches used in the description of hot and ultradense baryonic matter in and out of equilibrium, and discuss the regions in the phase diagram where heavy-ion collisions and neutron star mergers can overlap. Future perspectives are discussed to help define a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary strategy to map out the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter from heavy ion collisions to neutron stars.

title: Probing Fundamental Physics with Gravitational Waves: The Next Generation
authors: Scott E. Perkins, Nicolás Yunes, Emanuele Berti
topic: Gravitational wave observations of compact binary mergers are already providing stringent tests of general relativity and constraints on modified gravity. Ground-based interferometric detectors will soon reach design sensitivity and they will be followed by third-generation upgrades, possibly operating in conjunction with space-based detectors. How will these improvements affect our ability to investigate fundamental physics with gravitational waves? The answer depends on the timeline for the sensitivity upgrades of the instruments, but also on astrophysical compact binary population uncertainties, which determine the number and signal-to-noise ratio of the observed sources. We consider several scenarios for the proposed timeline of detector upgrades and various astrophysical population models. Using a stacked Fisher matrix analysis of binary black hole merger observations, we thoroughly investigate future theory-agnostic bounds on modifications of general relativity, as well as bounds on specific theories. For theory-agnostic bounds, we find that ground-based observations of stellar-mass black holes and LISA observations of massive black holes can each lead to improvements of 2-4 orders of magnitude with respect to present gravitational wave constraints, while multiband observations can yield improvements of 1-6 orders of magnitude. We also clarify how the relation between theory-agnostic and theory-specific bounds depends on the source properties.

title: Kilonova rates from spherical and axisymmetrical models
authors: József Kóbori, Zsolt Bagoly, Lajos G. Balázs
topic: Detecting the thermal emission from double neutron star merger events is a challenging task because of the quick fading of the observed flux. In order to create an efficient observing strategy for their observing method it is crucial to know their intrinsic rate. Unfortunately, the numerous models existing today predict this rate on a vary wide range. Hence, our goal in this paper is to investigate the effect of different level of approximations on the relative rate predictions. Also, we study the effect of distinct ejecta mass lay-outs on the light curve. We find that the ratio of the expected kilonova detections of the spherical to axisymmetrical models is 6:1 (or 2:1, depending on the input parameter set applied in our work). Nevertheless, the light curve shape is only slightly affected by the various ejecta alignments. This means that different ejecta layouts can produce light curves with similar shapes making it a challenging task to infer the structure of the matter outflow. Thus, we conclude that the uncertainty in the rate predictions arising from the various ejecta mass distribution models is negligible compared to the errors present in other input parameters (e.g. binary neutron star merger rate). In addition, we show that up to moderate redshifts (z less 0.2) the redshift distribution type (observed or uniform in volume) does not affect the expected relative rate estimations.

title: Self-modulation of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Emanuele Sobacchi, Yuri Lyubarsky, Andrei M. Beloborodov, Lorenzo Sironi
topic: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extreme astrophysical phenomena entering the realm of non-linear optics, a field developed in laser physics. A classical non-linear effect is self-modulation. We examine the propagation of FRBs through the circumburst environment using the idealised setup of a monochromatic linearly-polarised GHz wave propagating through a uniform plasma slab of density N at distance R from the source. We find that self-modulation occurs if the slab is located within a critical radius Rcrit~1017(N/102cm-3)(L/1042ergs-1)cm, where L is the isotropic equivalent of the FRB luminosity. Self-modulation breaks the burst into pancakes transverse to the radial direction. When R less Rcrit, the transverse size of the pancakes is smaller than the Fresnel scale. The pancakes are strongly diffracted as the burst exits the slab, and interference between the pancakes produces a frequency modulation of the observed intensity with a sub-GHz bandwidth. When R~Rcrit, the transverse size of the pancakes becomes comparable with the Fresnel scale, and the effect of diffraction is weaker. The observed intensity is modulated on a timescale of ten microseconds, which corresponds to the radial width of the pancakes. Our results suggest that self-modulation may cause the temporal and frequency structure observed in FRBs.

title: Magnetic field evolution timescales in superconducting neutron stars
authors: Mikhail E. Gusakov, Elena M. Kantor, Dmitry D. Ofengeim
topic: The self-consistent approach to the magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores, developed recently, is generalised to the case of superfluid and superconducting neutron stars. Applying this approach to the cold matter of neutron star cores composed of neutrons, protons, electrons, and muons we find that, similarly to the case of normal matter, an arbitrary configuration of the magnetic field may result in generation of macroscopic particle velocities, strongly exceeding their diffusive (relative) velocities. This effect substantially accelerates evolution of the magnetic field in the stellar core. An hierarchy of timescales of such evolution at different stages of neutron star life is proposed and discussed. It is argued that the magnetic field in the core cannot be considered as frozen or vanishing and that its temporal evolution should affect the observational properties of neutron stars.

title: FRB 181112 as a Rapidly-Rotating Massive Neutron Star just after a Binary Neutron Star Merger?: Implications for Future Constraints on Neutron Star Equations of State
authors: Shotaro Yamasaki (HUJI), Tomonori Totani (U. Tokyo), Kenta Kiuchi (AEI)
topic: The light curve of the fast radio burst (FRB) 181112 is resolved into four successive pulses, and the time interval (~0.8 ms) between the first and third pulses coincides with that between the second and fourth pulses, which can be interpreted as a neutron star (NS) spinning at a period of about 0.8 ms. Although this period is shorter than the most rapidly rotating pulsar currently known (1.4 ms), it is typical for a simulated massive NS formed immediately after the coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNS). Therefore, a BNS merger is a good candidate for the origin of this FRB if the periodicity is real. We discuss the future implications that can be obtained if such a periodicity is detected from FRBs simultaneously with gravitational waves (GW). The remnant spin period Prem inferred from the FRB observation is unique information which is not readily obtained by current GW observations at the post-merger phase. If combined with the mass of the merger remnant Mrem inferred from GW data, it would set a new constraint on the equation of state of nuclear matter. Furthermore, the post-merger quantity Prem/Mrem, or the tidal deformability of the merger remnant, is closely related to the binary tidal deformability parameter Lambda of NSs before they merge, and a joint FRB-GW observation will establish a new limit on Lambda. Thus, if Lambda is also well measured by GW data, a comparison between these two will provide further insights into the nature of nuclear matter and BNS mergers.

title: The maximum energy of shock-accelerated electrons in a microturbulent magnetic field
authors: Donald C. Warren, Catherine A. A. Beauchemin, Maxim V. Barkov, Shigehiro Nagataki
topic: Relativistic shocks propagating into a medium with low magnetization are generated and sustained by small-scale but very strong magnetic field turbulence. This so-called "microturbulence" modifies the typical shock acceleration process, and in particular that of electrons. In this work we perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of electrons encountering shocks with microturbulent fields. The simulations cover a three-dimensional parameter space in shock speed, acceleration efficiency, and peak magnetic field strength. From these, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was employed to estimate the maximum electron momentum from the MC-simulated electron spectra. Having estimated this quantity at many points well-distributed over an astrophysically relevant parameter space, an MCMC method was again used to estimate the parameters of an empirical formula that computes the maximum momentum of a Fermi-accelerated electron population anywhere in this parameter space. The maximum energy is well-approximated as a broken power-law in shock speed, with the break occurring when the shock decelerates to the point where electrons can begin to escape upstream from the shock.

title: Formation of spiral structure from the violent relaxation of self-gravitating disks
authors: Tirawut Worrakitpoonpon 
topic: We present the numerical study of the formation of spiral structure in the context of violent relaxation. Initial conditions are the out-of-equilibrium disks of self-gravitating particles in rigid rotation. By that mechanism, robust and non-stationary spiral arms can be formed within a few free-fall times by the shearing of the mass ejection following the collapse. With a closer look, we find different properties of the arms in connection with the initial configuration. The winding degree tends to increase with initial angular speed provided that a disk is thin. If disk surface is circular, both number and position of arms are governed by the Poissonian density fluctuations that produce more arms as more particles are introduced. On the contrary, if the surface ellipticity is imposed, the number of arms and their placement are effectively controlled. Otherwise, the increase of thickness leads to a complicated outcome since the number of arms and winding degree are less effectively controlled. We speculate that this complexity is caused by a strong non-axisymmetric field during the violent relaxation that disorganizes the pre-collapse motion and the concentration of particles.

topic: The giant flares of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) have long been proposed to contribute to at least a subsample of the observed short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the high-energy data of the recent bright short GRB 200415A, which was located close to the Sculptor galaxy. Our results suggest that a magnetar giant flare provides the most natural explanation for most observational properties of GRB 200415A, including its location, temporal and spectral features, energy, statistical correlations, and high-energy emissions. On the other hand, the compact star merger GRB model is found to have difficulty reproducing such an event in a nearby distance. Future detections and follow-up observations of similar events are essential to firmly establish the connection between SGR giant flares and a subsample of nearby short GRBs.

title: Effect of the crust on neutron star empirical relations
authors: Márcio Ferreira, Constança Providência
topic: We analyze how the crust equation of state affects several neutron star properties and how it impacts on possible constraints inferred from astrophysical observations. Using three distinct crusts, we generate three sets of model-independent equations of state describing stellar matter from a Taylor expansion around saturation density. The equations of state are thermodynamically consistent, causal, and compatible with astrophysical observations. The relations between the tidal deformability Lmabda and compactness C, Love number k2 and radius of neutron star with mass M are studied, and the effect of the crust equation of state on these relations analyzed. In most of the relations, the impact of the crust equation of state is not larger that 2\%. If, however, a fixed neutron star mass is considered, the relation between the tidal deformability and the radius depends on the crust. We have found that the relation LmabdaMi=[eq] becomes almost exact and crust independent for massive neutron stars. It is shown that it is possible to determine the tidal deformability of an 1.4Msun star from the GW179817 effective tidal deformability Lmabda~ with an accuracy of at least ≈10%. A high correlation between Lmabda~ and the radius of the most massive star of the neutron star binary was confirmed, however, it was demonstrated that the crust has an effect of 14% on this relation. We have found that the relation Lmabda1/Lmabda2=qa depends on Mchirp as..

title: Oscillations of hypermassive compact stars with gravitational radiation and viscosity
authors: Peter B. Rau, Armen Sedrakian
topic: Binary neutron star mergers, such as the multimessenger GW170817 event, may produce hypermassive compact objects which are supported against collapse by the internal circulation of the fluid within the star. We compute their unstable modes of oscillations driven by gravitational wave radiation and shear viscosity, modeling them as triaxial Riemann ellipsoids. We work in a perturbative regime, where the gravitational radiation reaction force is taken into account at 2.5-post-Newtonian order and find unstable modes with dissipation timescales larger 1 ms which are relevant to the transient state of a hypermassive remnant of a merger. We show that the secular instabilities are dominated by gravitational wave radiation. If the shear viscosity is included, it can increase the growth times or even stabilize the unstable modes, but it must have values several orders of magnitude larger than predicted for cold neutron stars.

title: Stringent Search for Precursor Emission in Short GRBs from Fermi/GBM data and Physical Implications
authors: Jie-Shuang Wang, Zong-Kai Peng, Jin-Hang Zou, Bin-Bin Zhang, Bing Zhang
topic: We perform a stringent search for precursor emission of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) from the Fermi/GBM data and find 16 precursor events with greater 4.5 sigma significance. We find that the durations of the main SGRB emission (TGRB) and the precursor emission (Tpre), as well as the waiting time (Twt) in between, are roughly comparable to each other, with Twt≈2.8T1.2GRB approximately satisfied for most cases except one significant outlier. We also perform spectral analyses to the precursors and SGRBs, and find that the spectra of precursor emission can be fitted with the blackbody, non-thermal cutoff power law and/or power law models. We consider several possible models for precursor emission in SGRBs and find that the luminosity and spectral shape may be explained by the the shock breakout or the photospheric radiation of a fireball launched after the merger for thermal precursors, or magnetospheric interaction between two NSs prior to the merger for non-thermal precursors. For the fireball photospheric model, a matter-dominated jet is preferred and a constraint on the fireball Lorentz factor can be placed as Gamma~30. For the magnetospheric interaction model, jet launching mechanism may be constrained.

title: A Consistent Modeling of Neutrino-driven Wind with Accretion Flow onto a Protoneutron Star and its Implications for Ni Production
authors: Ryo Sawada (Kyoto Sangyo Univ.), Yudai Suwa (Kyoto Sangyo Univ. & YITP, Kyoto Univ.)
topic: Details of the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are not yet fully understood. There is now an increasing number of successful examples of reproducing explosions in the first-principles simulations, which have shown a slow increase of explosion energy. However, it was recently pointed out that the growth rates of the explosion energy of these simulations are insufficient to produce enough 56Ni mass to account for observations. We refer to this issue as the `nickel mass problem' (Ni problem, hereafter) in this paper. The neutrino-driven wind is suggested as one of the most promising candidates for the solution to the Ni problem, in literature. In this paper, we first built a consistent model of the neutrino-driven wind with an accretion flow onto a protoneutron star (PNS), by connecting a steady-state solution of the neutrino-driven wind and a phenomenological mass accretion model. Our conclusion is that it is difficult to solve the Ni problem, by continuous injection of 56Ni by the neutrino-driven wind. We suggest that the total amount of synthesized 56Ni can be estimated robustly if simulations are followed up to ~2 seconds.

title: Gravitational Waves from Core-Collapse Supernovae
authors: Ernazar Abdikamalov, Giulia Pagliaroli, David Radice
topic: We summarize our current understanding of gravitational wave emission from core-collapse supernovae. We review the established results from multi-dimensional simulations and, wherever possible, provide back-of-the-envelope calculations to highlight the underlying physical principles. The gravitational waves are predominantly emitted by protoneutron star oscillations. In slowly rotating cases, which represent the most common type of the supernovae, the oscillations are excited by multi-dimensional hydrodynamic instabilities, while in rare rapidly rotating cases, the protoneutron star is born with an oblate deformation due to the centrifugal force. The gravitational wave signal may be marginally visible with current detectors for a source within our galaxy, while future third-generation instruments will enable more robust and detailed observations. The rapidly rotating models that develop non-axisymmetric instabilities may be visible up to a megaparsec distance with the third-generation detectors. Finally, we discuss strategies for multi-messenger observations of supernovae.

title: Systematics of prompt black-hole formation in neutron star mergers
authors: Andreas Bauswein, Sebastian Blacker, Georgios Lioutas, Theodoros Soultanis, Vimal Vijayan, Nikolaos Stergioulas
topic: This study addresses the collapse behavior of neutron star (NS) mergers expressed through the binary threshold mass Mthres for prompt black hole (BH) formation, which we determine by relativistic hydrodynamical simulations for a set of 40 equation of state (EoS) models. Mthres can be well described by various fit formulae involving stellar parameters of nonrotating NSs. Using these relations we compute which constraints on NS radii and the tidal deformability are set by current and future merger detections revealing information about the merger product. We systematically investigate the impact of the binary mass ratio q=M1/M2 and assemble different fits, which may be applicable in different situations. We find fit formulae for Mthres including an explicit q dependence, which are valid in a broad range of 0.7<=q<=1 and which are nearly as tight as relations for fixed mass ratios. For most EoS models except for some extreme cases the threshold mass of asymmetric mergers is equal or smaller than the one of equal-mass binaries. Generally, the impact of the binary mass asymmetry on M_thres becomes stronger with more extreme mass ratios, while Mthres is approximately constant for small deviations from q=1, i.e. for 0.85<=q<=1.

title: Modeling Kilonova Light Curves: Dependence on Nuclear Inputs
authors: Y. L. Zhu, K. Lund, J. Barnes, T. M. Sprouse, N. Vassh, G. C. McLaughlin, M. R. Mumpower, R. Surman
topic: The mergers of binary neutron stars, as well as black hole-neutron star systems, are expected to produce an electromagnetic counterpart that can be analyzed to infer the element synthesis that occurred in these events. We investigate one source of uncertainties pertinent to lanthanide-rich outflows: the nuclear inputs to rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis calculations. We begin by examining thirty-two different combinations of nuclear inputs: eight mass models, two types of spontaneous fission rates, and two types of fission daughter product distributions. We find that such nuclear physics uncertainties typically generate at least one order of magnitude uncertainty in key quantities such as the nuclear heating (one and a half orders of magnitude at one day post-merger), the bolometric luminosity (one order of magnitude at five days post-merger), and the inferred mass of material from the bolometric luminosity (factor of eight when considering the eight to ten days region). Since particular nuclear processes are critical for determining the electromagnetic signal, we provide tables of key nuclei undergoing β-decay, α-decay, and spontaneous fission important for heating at different times, identifying decays that are common among the many nuclear input combinations.

title: Gravitational wave friction in light of GW170817 and GW190521
authors: S. Mastrogiovanni, L. Haegel, C. Karathanasis, I. Magana-Hernandez, D. A. Steer
topic: We use the gravitational wave (GW) events GW170817 and GW190521, together with their proposed electromagnetic counterparts, to constrain cosmological parameters and theories of gravity beyond General Relativity (GR). In particular we consider models with a time-varying Planck mass, large extra-dimensions, and a phenomenological parametrization covering several beyond-GR theories. In all three cases, this introduces a friction term into the GW propagation equation, effectively modifying the GW luminosity distance. We set constraints on LambdaCDM parameters and GR deviation parameters using two sets of priors on the Hubble constant and matter energy density. With priors set to the measured Planck's mission values, we find that with the inclusion of GW190521, the two GR deviation parameters constraints improves by a factor ∼10, we report a number of spacetime dimensions compatible with 4 with an precision of 2.5% (at 95\% CL) and an upper limit to the variation of Netwon's constant at the epoch of GW170817 les20%. With wide priors on the Hubble constant and matter energy density, we show that it is still possible to constrain the lambdaCDM parameters and GR deviation parameters conjointly from GW170817 and GW190521 obtaining constraints on GR deviation parameters which are a factor 2−6 worse than the results using restricted priors on LambdaCDM parameters.

title: Nucleosynthesis in magneto-rotational supernovae
authors: Moritz Reichert, Martin Obergaulinger, Marius Eichler, Miguel-Ángel Aloy, Almudena Arcones
topic: We present the nucleosynthesis from magneto-rotational supernovae (MR-SN) including neutrino-driven and magneto-rotational-driven ejecta based, for the first time, on two-dimensional simulations with accurate neutrino transport. The models analysed here have different rotation and magnetic fields, allowing us to explore the impact of these two key ingredients. The accurate neutrino transport of the simulations is critical to analyse the slightly neutron rich and proton rich ejecta that are similar to the, also neutrino-driven, ejecta in standard supernovae. In the model with strong magnetic field, the r-process produces heavy elements up to the third r-process peak (A~195), in agreement with previous works. This model presents a jet-like explosion with proton-rich jets surrounded by neutron rich material where the r-process occurs. We have estimated a lower limit for 56Ni of 2.5*10-2Msun, which is still well below the expected hypernova value. Longer simulations including the accretion disk evolution are required to get a final prediction. In addition, we have found that the late evolution is critical in a model with weak magnetic field in which lately ejected neutron rich matter produces elements up to the second r-process peak. Even if we cannot yet provide conclusions for hypernova nucleosynthesis, our results agree with observations of old stars and radioactive isotopes in supernova remnants. This makes MR-SNe a good additional scenario to neutron star mergers for the synthesis of heavy elements and brings us closer to understand their origin and the role of MR-SNe in the early galaxy nucleosynthesis.

title: Energy-momentum tensor of special relativistic fluids and Connection of relativistic and non-relativistic fluids in the new scaling
authors: Mahboobe Moeen Moghaddas
topic: In this paper, the relativistic fluids with the negligible magnetic field in the flat metric are studied. The iso-dimension scale in introduced, in this scale, all similar components of a variable have the same dimension. Also, the components of shear, bulk and heat flux tensors and the components of energy-momentum tensors are calculated in the cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems, all these components are derived in the iso-dimension scale. The non-relativistic shear, bulk and heat flux tensors and the components of energy-momentum tensor are derived in the limit of the relativistic fluids. Also, the connection of relativistic and non-relativistic fluids are seen. So, some distinctions of relativistic and non-relativistic fluids are displayed, for example in the relativistic fluids, the time derivative of velocity is created the shear stress tensor and derivative of velocity and temperature is created the heat flux energy-momentum tensor, etc.

title: Properties of the remnant disk and the dynamical ejecta produced in low-mass black hole-neutron star mergers
authors: Kota Hayashi, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Kenta Kiuchi, Koutarou Kyutoku, Masaru Shibata
topic: We systematically perform numerical-relativity simulations for low-mass black hole-neutron star mergers for the models with seven mass ratios Q=MBH/MNS ranging from 1.5 to 4.4, and three neutron-star equations of state, focusing on properties of matter remaining outside the black hole and ejected dynamically during the merger. We pay particular attention to the dependence on the mass ratio of the binaries. It is found that the rest mass remaining outside the apparent horizon after the merger depends only weakly on the mass ratio for the models with low mass ratios. It is also clarified that the rest mass of the ejecta has a peak at Q~3, and decreases steeply as the mass ratio decreases for the low mass-ratio case. We present a novel analysis method for the behavior of matter during the merger, focusing on the matter distribution in the phase space of specific energy and specific angular momentum. Then we model the matter distribution during and after the merger. Using the result of the analysis, we discuss the properties of the ejecta.

title: A Possible kilonova powered by magnetic wind from a newborn black hole
authors: Shuai-Bing Ma, Wei Xie, Bin Liao, Bin-Bin Zhang, Hou-Jun Lü, Yu Liu, Wei-Hua Lei
topic: The merger of binary neutron stars (NS-NS) as the progenitor of short Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been confirmed by the discovery of the association of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 with GRB 170817A. However, the merger product of binary NS remains an open question. An X-ray plateau followed by a steep decay ("internal plateau") has been found in some short GRBs, implying that a supra-massive magnetar operates as the merger remnant and then collapses into a newborn black hole (BH) at the end of the plateau. X-ray bump or second-plateau following the "internal plateau" is considered as the expected signature from the fallback accretion onto this newborn BH through Blandford-Znajek mechanism (BZ) mechanism. At the same time, a nearly isotropic wind energy driven by Blandford-Payne mechanism (BP) from the newborn BH's disk can produce a bright kilonova. Therefore, the bright kilonova observation for a short GRB with "internal plateau" (and followed by X-ray bump or second-plateau) provides further evidence for this scenario. In this paper, we find that GRB 160821B is a candidate of such a case, and the kilonova emission of GRB 160821B is possibly powered by the BP wind form a newborn BH. Future GW detection of GRB 160821B-like events may provide further support to this scenario, enable us to investigate the properties of the magnetar and the newborn BH, and constrain the equation of state of neutron stars.

title: Gravito-magnetic instabilities of Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics
authors: Hyerim Noh, Jai-chan Hwang
topic: We study gravito-magnetic instabilities of a static homogeneous medium with an aligned magnetic field in the two contexts of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD): first, MHD with post-Newtonian (PN) corrections, and second, special relativistic (SR) MHD with weak gravity. The analysis in the PN MHD is made without taking the temporal gauge condition, thus results are gauge-invariant. The PN corrections of the internal energy, pressure, sound velocity and the Alfvén velocity lower the critical (Jeans) wavelength. {All relativistic effects tend to destabilize the system.} Although the SR MHD with weak gravity is presented in the harmonic gauge, in the presence of gravity the stability analysis is strictly valid to Newtonian order. In the absence of gravity, the SR MHD is independent of the gauge condition. We present the plane wave velocities and the stability criteria in both cases.

title: Reconstructing Masses of Merging Neutron Stars from Stellar R-Process Abundance Signatures
authors: Erika M. Holmbeck, Anna Frebel, G. C. McLaughlin, Rebecca Surman, Rodrigo Fernandez, Brian D. Metzger, Matthew R. Mumpower, Trevor M. Sprouse
topic: Neutron star mergers (NSMs) are promising astrophysical sites for the rapid neutron-capture ("r-") process, but can their integrated yields explain the majority of heavy-element material in the Galaxy? One method to address this question has utilized a forward approach that propagates NSM rates and yields along with stellar formation rates, in the end comparing those results with observed chemical abundances of r-process-rich, metal-poor stars. In this work, we take the inverse approach by utilizing r-process-element abundance ratios of metal-poor stars as input to reconstruct the properties---especially the masses---of the neutron star (NS) binary progenitors of the r-process stars. This novel analysis provides an independent avenue for studying the population of the original neutron star binary systems that merged and produced the r-process material incorporated in Galactic metal-poor halo stars. We use ratios of elements typically associated with the limited-r process and the actinide region to those in the lanthanide region (i.e., Zr/Dy and Th/Dy) to probe the NS masses of the progenitor merger. We find that NSMs can account for all r-process material in metal-poor stars that display r-process signatures, while simultaneously reproducing the present-day distribution of double-NS (DNS) systems. However, the most r-process enhanced stars (the r-II stars) on their own would require progenitor NSMs of very asymmetric systems that are distinctly different from present ones in the Galaxy. As this analysis is model-dependent, we also explore variations in line with future expectation regarding potential theoretical and observational updates, and comment on how these variations impact our results.

authors: Maria Giovanna Dainotti, Aleksander Lenart, Giuseppe Sarracino, Shigehiro Nagataki, Salvatore Capozziello, Nissim Fraija
topic: A large fraction of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) lightcurves (LCs) shows X-ray plateaus. We analyze all GRBs with known redshifts presenting plateaus observed by \emph{The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} from its launch until August 2019. The fundamental plane relation between the rest-frame time and X-ray luminosity at the end of the plateau emission and the peak prompt luminosity holds for all the GRB classes when selection biases and cosmological evolutions are applied. We have discovered two important findings: 1) a new class of Long GRBs with good data coverage: the Platinum Sample; 2) the Platinum, the SNe-LGRB and the KN-SGRB samples, the second sample composed of GRBs associated spectroscopically with the SNe Ib,c, the third sample composed by 8 GRBs associated with Kilonovae or where there could have been such an association, yield the smallest intrinsic scatter. Furthermore, the distance from the Gold fundamental plane is a crucial discriminant among classes. In fact, we find that the distributions of the distances of the SNe-LGRB, SNe-LGRB-ABC, KN-SGRBs and SGRBs samples from the Gold fundamental plane are statistically different from the distribution of the Gold GRBs' distances from the Gold fundamental plane with and without considering evolution cases.

title: The impact of turbulent mixing on the galactic r-process enrichment by binary neutron star mergers across the entire metallicity range
authors: Irina Dvorkin, Frédéric Daigne, Stéphane Goriely, Elisabeth Vangioni, Joseph Silk
topic: We study the enrichment of the interstellar medium with rapid neutron capture (r-process) elements produced in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers using a semi-analytic model of the evolution of a Milky-Way-like galaxy in which we implemented merger rates and time delay distributions of BNS mergers consistent with the latest population synthesis models. In order to study the dispersion of the relative abundances of r-process elements and iron, we applied a turbulent mixing scheme, where the freshly synthesized elements are gradually dispersed in the interstellar medium. We show that within our model the abundances observed in Milky-Way stars, in particular the scatter at low metallicities, can be entirely explained by BNS mergers. Our results suggest that binary neutron star mergers could be the dominant source of r-process elements in low-metallicity environments, and can potentially also be the main source of r-process elements in disk stars at solar metallicity.

title: MHD Turbulence: A Biased Review
authors: Alexander A. Schekochihin (Oxford)
topic: This review puts the developments of the last few years in the context of the canonical time line (Kolmogorov to Iroshnikov-Kraichnan to Goldreich-Sridhar to Boldyrev). It is argued that Beresnyak's objection that Boldyrev's alignment theory violates the RMHD rescaling symmetry can be reconciled with alignment if the latter is understood as an intermittency effect. Boldyrev's scalings, recovered in this interpretation, are thus an example of a physical theory of intermittency in a turbulent system. Emergence of aligned structures brings in reconnection physics, so the theory of MHD turbulence intertwines with the physics of tearing and current-sheet disruption. Recent work on this by Loureiro, Mallet et al. is reviewed and it is argued that we finally have a reasonably complete picture of MHD cascade all the way to the dissipation scale. This picture appears to reconcile Beresnyak's Kolmogorov scaling of the dissipation cutoff with Boldyrev's aligned cascade.

title: Spin-polarized β-stable neutron star matter: the nuclear symmetry energy and GW170817 constraint
authors: Ngo Hai Tan, Dao T. Khoa, Doan Thi Loan
topic: Magnetic field of rotating pulsar might be so strong that the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star (NS) matter is significantly affected by the spin polarization of baryons. In the present work, the EOS of the spin-polarized nuclear matter is investigated in the nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock formalism, using a realistic density dependent nucleon-nucleon interaction with its spin and spin-isospin dependence accurately adjusted to the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock results for the spin-polarized nuclear matter. The nuclear symmetry energy and proton fraction are found to increase significantly with the increasing spin polarization of baryons, leading to a larger probability of the direct Urca process in the cooling of magnetar.

authors: X. L. Zhang, C. T. Zhang, X. J. Li, F. F. S, X. F. Dong, H. Y. Chang, Z. B. Zhang
topic: Thanks to more and more gamma-ray bursts with measured redshift and extended emission detected by the recent space telescopes, it is urgent and possible to check whether those previous energy correlations still satisfy for the particular sample involving only the bursts accompanied by tail radiations. Using 20 long and 22 short bursts with extended emission, we find that the popular gamma-ray energy correlations of the intrinsic peak energy versus the isotropic energy (Amati relation) and the intrinsic peak energy versus the peak luminosity (Yonetoku relation) do exist in either short or long bursts. However, these gamma-ray bursts with extended emissions are much better to be reclassified into two subgroups of E-I and E-II that make the above energy correlations more tight. As proposed by Zhang et al. (2018), the energy correlations can be utilized to distinguish these kinds of gamma-ray bursts in the plane of bolometric fluence versus peak energy as well. Interestingly, the peculiar short GRB 170817A belongs to the E-I group in the fluence versus peak energy plane, but it is an outlier of both Amati and Yonetoku relations even though the off-axis effect has been corrected.

title: Hybrid stars in the light of the merging event GW170817
authors: Alessandro Parisi, C. Vásquez Flores, C. Henrique Lenzi, Chian-Shu Chen, Germán Lugones
topic: We study quark-hadron hybrid stars with sharp phase transitions assuming that phase conversions at the interface are slow. Hadronic matter is described by a set of equations of state (EoS) based on the chiral effective field theory and quark matter by a generic bag model. Due to slow conversions at the interface, there is an extended region of stable hybrid stars with central densities above the density of the maximum mass star. We explore systematically the role of the transition pressure and the energy-density jump Δϵ at the interface on some global properties of hybrid stars. ... We also find that the LIGO/Virgo constrain (at 90% level) and the 2Msun requirement can be simultaneously fulfilled in a scenario where all hybrid configurations have masses larger than 1.6Msun and the hadronic EoS is not too stiff, such as several of our hybrid models involving a hadronic EoS of intermediate stiffness. In such scenario hybrid stars may exist in Nature but both objects in GW170817 were hadronic stars.

title: Modelling the prompt optical emission of GRB 180325A: the evolution of a spike from the optical to gamma-rays
authors: Rosa L. Becerra, Fabio De Colle, Jorge Cantó, Susana Lizano et al
topic: The transition from prompt to the afterglow emission is one of the most exciting and least understood phases in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Correlations among optical, X-ray and gamma-ray emission in GRBs have been explored, to attempt to answer whether the earliest optical emission comes from internal and/or external shocks. We present optical photometric observations of GRB 180325A collected with the TAROT and RATIR ground-based telescopes. These observations show two strong optical flashes with separate peaks at ~50s and ~120s, followed by a temporally extended optical emission. We also present X-rays and gamma-ray observations of GRB 180325A, detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and X-ray Telescope (XRT), on the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory, which both observed a narrow flash at ~80s. We show that the prompt gamma- and X-ray early emission shares similar temporal and spectral features consistent with internal dissipation within the relativistic outflow (e.g. by internal shocks or magnetic reconnection), while the early optical flashes are likely generated by the reverse shock that decelerates the ejecta as it sweeps up the external medium.

authors: Daniel Finstad, Duncan A. Brown
topic: Significant human and observational resources have been dedicated to electromagnetic followup of gravitational-wave events detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo. As the sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo improves, the rate of sources detected will increase. Margalit & Metzger (2019; arXiv:1904.11995) have suggested that it may be necessary to prioritize observations of future events. Optimal prioritization requires a rapid measurement of a gravitational-wave event's masses and spins, as these can determine the nature of any electromagnetic emission. We extend the relative binning method of Zackay et al. (2018; arXiv:1806.08792) to a coherent detector-network statistic.

topic: The identification of the electromagnetic counterpart candidate ZTF19abanrhr to the binary black hole merger GW190521 opens the possibility to infer cosmological parameters from this standard siren with a uniquely identified host galaxy. The distant merger allows for cosmological inference beyond the Hubble constant. Here we show that the three-dimensional spatial location of ZTF19abanrhr calculated from the electromagnetic data remains consistent with the updated sky localization of GW190521 provided by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. If ZTF19abanrhr is associated with the GW190521 merger and assuming a flat wCDM model we find that H0=48+24-10 km/s/Mpc, Ωm=0.39+0.38−0.29, and w0=-1.29+0.63-0.50 (median and 68% credible interval). If we use the Hubble constant value inferred from another gravitational-wave event, GW170817, as a prior for our analysis, together with assumption of a flat LambdaCDM and the model-independent constraint on the physical matter density ωm from Planck, we find H0=69.18.7-6.0 km/s/Mpc.

Prompt optical emission was detected by MASTER-SAAO 38 s after the alert, which dimmed from a magnitude (white-light) of ~10 to 16.2 mag over a period of ~10 ks, followed by a plateau phase lasting ~10 ks and then a decline to ~18 mag after 80 ks. The light curve shows complex structure, with four or five distinct breaks in the power-law decline rate. SALT/RSS linear spectropolarimetry of the afterglow began ~2.9 h after the burst, during the early part of the plateau phase of the light curve. Absorption lines seen at ~6010Å and 5490Å are identified with the Mg II 2799Å line from the host galaxy at z=1.15 and an intervening system located at z=0.96.

title: Core-Collapse Supernova Explosion Theory
authors: Adam Burrows, David Vartanyan
topic: Most supernova explosions accompany the death of a massive star. These explosions give birth to neutron stars and black holes and eject solar masses of heavy elements. However, determining the mechanism of explosion has been a half-century journey of great complexity. In this paper, we present our perspective of the status of this theoretical quest and the physics and astrophysics upon which its resolution seems to depend. The delayed neutrino-heating mechanism is emerging as a robust solution, but there remain many issues to address, not the least of which involves the chaos of the dynamics, before victory can unambiguously be declared. It is impossible to review in detail all aspects of this multi-faceted, more-than-half-century-long theoretical quest. Rather, we here map out the major ingredients of explosion and the emerging systematics of the observables with progenitor mass, as we currently see them. Our discussion will of necessity be speculative in parts, and many of the ideas may not survive future scrutiny.

title: Constraining neutron superfluidity with r-mode physics
authors: Elena M. Kantor, Mikhail E. Gusakov, Vasiliy A. Dommes
topic: We constrain the parameters of neutron superfluidity in the cores of neutron stars making use of the recently proposed effect of resonance stabilization of r-modes. To this end, we, for the first time, calculate the finite-temperature r-mode spectra for realistic models of rotating superfluid neutron stars, accounting for both muons and neutron-proton entrainment in their interiors. We find that the ordinary (normal) r-mode exhibits avoided crossings with superfluid r-modes at certain stellar temperatures and spin frequencies. Near the avoided crossings, the normal r-mode dissipates strongly, which leads to substantial suppression of the r-mode instability there. The extreme sensitivity of the positions of avoided crossings to the neutron superfluidity model allows us to constrain the latter by confronting the calculated spectra with observations of rapidly rotating neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries.

title: Constraints from LIGO/Virgo and NICER on quark star equation of state
authors: Ang Li, Jin-Liang Jiang, Shao-Peng Tang, Zhi-Qiang Miao, En-Ping Zhou, Ren-Xin Xu
topic: We investigate the quark star equation of state within the Bayesian statistical approach using the widely-used bag model, assuming the strange quark matter is in the color-flavor locked phase. Three types of filters are employed for the posterior distribution: Normal atomic nuclei should not decay into nonstrange quark matter, bulk strange quark matter should be more stable than the most bound atomic nuclei, and the lower limit on the maximum mass MTOV. The likelihood functions incorporate observational constraints from the tidal deformability measurement of the GW170817 binary merger by LIGO/Virgo and the measurements of PSR J0030+0451s mass and radius by NICER. The 90% posterior credible boundary around the most probable values of the quark star maximum mass is found to be MTOV=2.15+0.16-0.12Msum, with the radius and tidal deformability of a canonical 1.4Msun star being R1.4=11.52+0.51-0.46km and Λ1.4=670+230−160, respectively. Nevertheless, the color superconductivity gap is poorly constrained by those observed global star properties, and no clear evidence about the sound speed behavior in strange quark matter is manifested. A possible probe of the quark pairing gap through future tidal deformability measurement of massive quark stars (close to MTOV) is also discussed.

title: LOC program for line radiative transfer
authors: M. Juvela
topic: Radiative transfer modelling is part of many astrophysical numerical simulations. It is also used by itself, to make synthetic observations based on models and to assist direct analysis of observations.
Our aim is to provide a line radiative transfer (RT) program that makes good use of multi-core CPUs and GPUs. Parallelisation is essential to speed up computations and to enable the tackling of large modelling tasks with personal computers.
The program LOC is based on ray-tracing (i.e. not Monte Carlo) and uses standard accelerated lambda iteration (ALI) methods for faster convergence. The program works on 1D and 3D grids. The 1D version makes use of symmetries to speed up the RT calculations. The 3D version works with octree grids and, to enable calculations with large models, is optimised for low memory usage.
Tests show that LOC gives results that are in agreement with other RT codes to within ~2%. This is typical of code-to-code differences, which often are related to different interpretations of the model set-up. LOC run times compare favourably especially with those of Monte Carlo codes. In 1D tests, LOC runs were by up to a factor ~20 faster on a GPU than on a single CPU core. In spite of the complex path calculations, up to ~10 speed-up was observed also for 3D models using octree discretisation. Modern GPUs enable calculations of models with up to hundreds of millions of cells.

title: On the delay times of merging double neutron stars
authors: Laura Greggio, Paolo Simonetti, Francesca Matteucci
topic: The merging rate of double neutron stars (DNS) has a great impact on many astrophysical issues, including the interpretation of gravitational waves signals, of the short Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and of the chemical properties of stars in galaxies. Such rate depends on the distribution of the delay times (DDT) of the merging events. In this paper we derive a theoretical DDT of merging DNS following from the characteristics of the clock controlling their evolution. We show that the shape of the DDT is governed by a few key parameters, primarily the lower limit and the slope of the distribution of the separation of the DNS systems at birth. With a parametric approach we investigate on the observational constraints on the DDT from the cosmic rate of short GRBs and the Europium to Iron ratio in Milky Way stars, taken as tracer of the products of the explosion. We find that the local rate of DNS merging requires that about 1 percent of neutron stars progenitors live in binary systems which end their evolution as merging DNS within a Hubble time. The redshift distribution of short GRBs does not yet provide a strong constraint on the shape of the DDT, although the best fitting models have a shallow DDT. The chemical pattern in Milky Way stars requires an additional source of Europium besides the products from merging DNS, which weakens the related requirement on the DDT. At present both constraints can be matched with the same DDT for merging DNS.

title: Effect of Inner Crust EoS on Neutron star Mass and Radii
authors: Ishfaq Ahmad Rather, Anisul Ain Usmani, Suresh Kumar Patra
topic: The neutron star maximum mass and the radius are investigated within the framework of relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The variation in the radius at the canonical mass, R1.4, using different inner crust equation of state (EoS) with different symmetry energy slope parameter is also studied. It is found that although the NS maximum mass and the corresponding radius do not vary much with different slope parameter inner crust EoS, the radius at 1.4Msun follows a linear correlation with the symmetry energy slope parameter for all core parameter sets.

topic: This study presents a comprehensive chemo-dynamical analysis of LAMOST J1109+0754, a bright (V = 12.8), extremely metal-poor (\abund{Fe}{H} = -3.17) star, with a strong \textit{r}-process enhancement (\abund{Eu}{Fe} = +0.94 pm 0.12) We obtain chemical abundances of 31 elements (from lithium to thorium). The abundance ratios (\abund{X}{Fe}) of the light-elements (Z less 30) suggest a massive Population III progenitor in the 13.4-29.5 ,Msun mass range. The heavy-element (30 less Z less 90) abundance pattern of J1109+075 agrees extremely well with the scaled-Solar \textit{r}-process signature. We have developed a novel approach to trace the kinematic history and orbital evolution of J1109+0754 with a c\textbf{O}smologically pived varying Galactic textbftential (the ORIENT) constructed from snapshots of a simulated Milky-Way analog taken from the \texttt{Illustris-TNG} simulation. The orbital evolution within this Milky Way-like galaxy, along with the chemical-abundance pattern implies that J1109+0754 likely originated in a low-mass dwarf galaxy located sim 60\,kpc from the center of the Galaxy, which was accreted ~ 6 - 7\,Gyr ago, and that the star now belongs to the outer-halo population.

title: Mergers of binary neutron star systems: a multi-messenger revolution
authors: Elena Pian
topic: On 17 August 2017, less than two years after the direct detection of gravitational radiation from the merger of two ~30 Msun black holes, a binary neutron star merger was identified as the source of a gravitational wave signal of ~100 s duration that occurred at less than 50 Mpc from Earth. A short GRB was independently identified in the same sky area by the Fermi and INTEGRAL satellites for high energy astrophysics, which turned out to be associated with the gravitational event. Prompt follow-up observations at all wavelengths led first to the detection of an optical and infrared source located in the spheroidal galaxy NGC4993 and, with a delay of ~10 days, to the detection of radio and X-ray signals. This paper revisits these observations and focusses on the early optical/infrared source, which was thermal in nature and powered by the radioactive decay of the unstable isotopes of elements synthesized via rapid neutron capture during the merger and in the phases immediately following it. The far-reaching consequences of this event for cosmic nucleosynthesis and for the history of heavy elements formation in the Universe are also illustrated.

title: The special point on the hybrid star mass--radius diagram and its multi--messenger implications
authors: Mateusz Cierniak, David Blaschke
topic: We show the existence and investigate the location of the special point (SP) in which hybrid neutron star mass-radius (M-R) curves have to cross each other when they belong to a class of hybrid equation of state (EoS) constructed with generic constant--speed--of--sound (CSS) quark matter models for which the onset deconfinement is varied. We demonstrate that for a three-parameter CSS model the position of the SP in the M-R diagram is largely independent of the choice of the hadronic EoS, but in dependence on the stiffness of the quark matter EoS it spans a region that we identify. We find that the difference between the maximum mass and the SP mass depends on the mass at the onset of deconfinement so that an upper limit of 0.19 Msun for this difference is obtained from which a lower limit on the radius of hybrid stars is deduced.For neutron stars with M less 2.4 Msun this lies within a more constraining lower limit of the neutron star radius from multi-messenger observations. Together with a lower limit on the radius of hadronic stars we identify a region in the M-R diagram which can be occupied only by hybrid stars. Accordingly, we suggest that a NICER radius measurement on the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 in the range of 10.7-11.8 km would indicate that this pulsar is a hybrid neutron star with deconfined quark matter in the inner core.

title: The Population III origin of GW190521
authors: Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm
topic: We explore the possibility that the recently detected black hole binary (BHB) merger event GW190521 originates from the first generation of massive, metal-free, so-called Population III (Pop III), stars. Based on improved binary statistics derived from N-body simulations of Pop III star clusters, we calculate the merger rate densities of Pop III BHBs similar to GW190521, in two evolution channels: classical binary stellar evolution and dynamical hardening in high-redshift nuclear star clusters. Both channels can explain the observed rate density. But the latter is favoured by better agreement with observation and less restrictions on uncertain parameters. Our analysis also indicates that given the distinct features of the two channels, future observation of BHB mergers similar to GW190521 with third-generation gravitational wave detectors will greatly improve our knowledge of the evolution of Pop III BHBs, especially for their dynamics during cosmic structure formation.

title: Confronting the Magnetar Interpretation of Fast Radio Bursts Through Their Host Galaxy Demographics
authors: Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, J. Xavier Prochaska, Kasper E. Heintz, Wen-fai Fong
topic: We explore the prompt magnetar progenitor scenario in the context of fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies demographics and offset distributions. Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 1015 G with a short decay lifetime of less than 104 years. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star-formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of  secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at 95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies.

title: Screening Effects on Electron Capture Rates and Type Ia Supernova Nucleosynthesis
authors: Kanji Mori, Toshio Suzuki, Michio Honma, Michael A. Famiano, Toshitaka Kajino, Motohiko Kusakabe, Baha A. Balantekin
topic: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are believed to be a thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf, but the mass of their progenitors is still an open problem. In near-Chandrasekhar-mass (near-M_Ch) models of SNe Ia, the central density reaches >10^9 g cm^{-3}. The electron chemical potential becomes higher than the Q-values of electron capture (EC) transitions between fp-shell nuclei, so a portion of the available electrons is captured by iron group elements and thus neutron-rich isotopes are formed. Since EC reaction rates are sensitive to the density, the degree of neutronization is a key to distinguish near- and sub-M_Ch models. In order to compare observations and theoretical models, an accurate treatment of EC reactions is necessary. In previous theoretical works, however, effects of electron screening on ECs are ignored. Screening lowers EC rates and thus leads to a higher electron fraction. We implement electron screening on ECs to calculate explosive SN Ia nucleosynthesis in a near-M_Ch single degenerate model.

title: On the formation of GW190814
authors: Wenbin Lu, Paz Beniamini, Clément Bonnerot
topic: The LIGO-Virgo collaboration recently reported a puzzling event, GW190814, with component masses of 23 and 2.6 solar masses. Motivated by the relatively small rate of such a coalescence and the fact that the mass of the secondary is close to the total mass of known binary neutron star (bNS) systems, we propose that GW190814 was a second-generation merger from a hierarchical triple system, i.e., the remnant from the bNS coalescence was able to merge again with the 23 Msun black hole (BH) tertiary. We show that this occurs at a sufficiently high probability provided that the semimajor axis of the outer orbit is less than a few AU at the time of bNS coalescence. It remains to be explored whether the conditions for the formation of such tight triple systems are commonly realized in the Universe, especially in low metallicity (less than 0.1 solar) environments. Our model provides a number of predictions. (1) The spin of the secondary in GW190814-like systems is 0.6 to 0.7. (2) The component mass distribution from a large sample of LIGO sources should have a narrow peak between 2.5 and ~3.5 Msun, whereas the range between ~3.5 and ~5 Msun stays empty (provided that stellar evolution does not generate such BHs in the "mass gap"). (3) About 90% (10%) of GW190814-like events have an eccentricity

title: Simulating the dynamics and non-thermal emission of relativistic magnetised jets I. Dynamics
authors: Dipanjan Mukherjee, Gianluigi Bodo, Andrea Mignone, Paola Rossi, Bhargav Vaidya
topic: We have performed magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic jets from supermassive blackholes over a few tens of kpc for a range of jet parameters. One of the primary aims were to investigate the effect of different MHD instabilities on the jet dynamics and their dependence on the choice of jet parameters. We find that two dominant MHD instabilities affect the dynamics of the jet, small scale Kelvin- Helmholtz (KH) modes and large scale kink modes, whose evolution depend on internal jet parameters like the Lorentz factor, the ratio of the density and pressure to the external medium and the magnetisation and hence consequently on the jet power. Low power jets are susceptible to both instabilities, kink modes for jets with higher central magnetic field and KH modes for lower magnetisation. Moderate power jets do not show appreciable growth of kink modes, but KH modes develop for lower magnetisation. Higher power jets are generally stable to both instabilities. Such instabilities decelerate and decollimate the jet while inducing turbulence in the cocoon, with consequences on the magnetic field structure. We model the dynamics of the jets following a generalised treatment of the Begelman-Cioffi relations which we present here.

title: Plasma kinetic effects in relativistic radiation mediated shocks
authors: Amir Levinson
topic: Fast shocks that form in optically thick media are mediated by Compton scattering and, if relativistic, pair creation. Since the radiation force acts primarily on electrons and positrons, the question arises of how the force is mediated to the ions which are the dominant carriers of the shock energy. It has been widely thought that a small charge separation induced by the radiation force generates electric field inside the shock that decelerates the ions. In this paper we argue that, while this is true in sub-relativistic shocks which are devoid of positrons, in relativistic radiation mediated shocks (RRMS), which are dominated by newly created e+e− pairs, additional coupling is needed, owing to the opposite electric force acting on electrons and positrons. Specifically, we show that dissipation of the ions energy must involve collective plasma interactions. By constructing a multi-fluid model for RRMS that incorporates friction forces, we estimate that momentum transfer between electrons and positrons (and/or ions) via collective interactions on scales of tens to thousands proton skin depths

title: Can we constrain the aftermath of binary neutron star mergers with short gamma-ray bursts?
authors: Barbara Patricelli, Maria Grazia Bernardini
topic: The joint observation of GW170817 and GRB170817A proved that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are progenitors of short Gamma-ray Bursts (SGRB): this established a direct link between the still unsettled SGRB central engine and the outcome of BNS mergers, whose nature depends on the equation of state (EOS) and on the masses of the NSs. We propose a novel method to probe the central engine of SGRBs based on this link. We produce an extended catalog of BNS mergers by combining recent theoretically predicted BNS merger rate as a function of redshift and the NS mass distribution inferred from measurements of Galactic BNSs. We use this catalog to predict the number of BNS systems ending as magnetars (stable or Supramassive NS) or BHs (formed promptly or after the collapse of a hypermassive NS) for different EOSs, and we compare these outcomes with the observed rate of SGRBs. Despite the uncertainties mainly related to the poor knowledge of the SGRB jet structure, we find that for most EOSs the rate of magnetars produced after BNS mergers is sufficient to power all the SGRBs, while scenarios with only BHs as possible central engine seems to be disfavoured.

title: Magnetic Ergostars, Jet Formation and Gamma-Ray Bursts: Ergoregions versus Horizons
authors: Milton Ruiz, Antonios Tsokaros, Stuart L. Shapiro, Kyle C. Nelli, Sam Qunell
topic: We perform the first fully general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of dynamically stable hypermassive neutron stars with and without ergoregions to assess the impact of ergoregions on launching magnetically--driven outflows. The hypermassive neutron stars are modeled by a compressible and causal equation of state and are initially endowed with a dipolar magnetic field extending from the stellar interior into its exterior. We find that, after a few Alfvén times, magnetic field lines in the ergostar (star that contains ergoregions) and the normal star have been tightly wound in both cases into a helical funnel within which matter begins to flow outward. The maximum Lorentz factor in the outflow is Gamma = 2.5, while the force-free parameter holds at B2/8pi prho 0 leq 10. These values are incompatible with highly relativistic, magnetically-driven outflows (jets) and short γ-ray bursts. We compare these results with those of a spinning black hole surrounded by a magnetized, massless accretion disk that launches a bona fide jet. Our simulations suggest that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism for launching relativistic jets only operates when a black hole is present, though the Poynting luminosity in all cases is comparable. Therefore, one cannot distinguish a magnetized, accreting black hole from a magnetized hypermassive neutron star in the so-called mass-gap based solely on the value of the observed Poynting luminosity.

topic: We study the production of light elements (Z less 20) in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers by combining detailed nucleosynthesis calculations with the outcome of numerical relativity merger simulations. We explore different microphysical equations of state and binary mass ratios, and find that hydrogen and helium are the most abundant light elements. For both elements, the decay of free neutrons is the driving nuclear reaction. Hydrogen is produced in extremely fast expanding ejecta while helium is synthesized in association with heavy r-process elements. By computing synthetic spectra, we find that the possibility of detecting hydrogen and helium features in kilonova spectra is very unlikely.

title: Rank-3 Moment Closures in General Relativistic Neutrino Transport
authors: Sherwood Richers
topic: Many modern simulations of accretion disks use moment-based methods for radiation transport to determine the thermal evolution of the disk and the properties of the ejected matter. The popular M1 scheme evolves the rank-0 and rank-1 moments requires an analytic approximation for the rank-2 and higher tensors. We present the open-source Monte Carlo steady-state general-relativistic neutrino transport code SedonuGR, which we use to asses fundamental analytic closure assumptions, quantify proposed closure errors, and test an extension of the MEFD closure to the rank-3 moment. We demonstrate that the fundamental assumptions employed in all analytic closures are strongly violated. This violation is most evident at the interface between the equatorial disk and the evacuated polar regions. Finally, we calculate the neutrino momentum and energy deposition rate from neutrino pair annihilation, and demonstrate that a moment-based annihilation power calculation is accurate to at most ~20% if the rank-2 and higher moments are neglected.

title: Formation of GW190521 via gas accretion onto Population III stellar black hole remnants born in high-redshift minihalos
authors: Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, Zoltán Haiman
topic: The recent gravitational wave merger event, GW190521, has challenged our understanding of the stellar-mass black hole (BH) formation. The primary and secondary BH are both inferred to fall inside the pair-instability (PI) mass gap. Here we propose that the formation of such binaries is possible through gas accretion onto the BH remnants of Population III (Pop~III) stars born in high-redshift (z greater 10) minihalos. Once the parent halo has grown to the atomic-cooling limit, even brief episodes of gas accretion in the dense central regions of the halo can increase the masses of Pop~III remnant BHs above the PI limit. Starting with a BBH with an initial mass of O(100) Msun we find that it would only need to spend about 100~Myr in the inner few pc of an atomic-cooling halo to accrete about 50~Msun of material and resemble a system similar to GW190521. The dynamical friction timescale for the binary to sink to the dense inner region of its parent halo is comparable or shorter than the accretion timescale required to increase their mass above the PI limit. Once in the core of the halo, the binary can enter a phase of hyper-Eddington accretion, where it would only take a few thousand years to exceed the PI limit through accretion.

title: Neutron stars mergers in a stochastic chemical evolution model: impact of time delay distributions
authors: L. Cavallo, G. Cescutti, F. Matteucci
topic: We study the evolution of the [Eu/Fe] ratio in the Galactic halo by means of a stochastic chemical evolution model considering merging neutron stars as polluters of europium. We improved our previous stochastic chemical evolution model by adding a time delay distribution for the coalescence of the neutron stars, instead of constant delays. The stochastic chemical evolution model can reproduce the trend and the observed spread in the [Eu/Fe] data with neutron star mergers as unique producers if we assume: i) a delay time distribution per event, iii) progenitors of neutron stars in the range 9-50Msun and iv) a constant fraction of massive stars in the initial mass function (0.02) that produce neutron star mergers. Our best model is obtained by relaxing point iv) and assuming a fraction that varies with metallicity. We confirm that the mixed scenario with both merging neutron stars and supernovae as europium producers can provide a good agreement with the data relaxing the constraints on the distribution time delays for the coalescence of neutron stars. Adopting our best model, we also reproduce the dispersion of [Eu/Fe] at a given metallicity, which depends on the fraction of massive stars that produce neutron star mergers. Future high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, such as 4MOST and WEAVE, will produce the necessary statistics to constrain at best this parameter.

We illustrate the approach by employing a gray opacity in an optically thick medium. As numerical demonstrations we present results for two test problems, namely stationary, slab-symmetric solutions in flat spacetimes, including shocks, and heated Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse to a black hole. For the latter, we carefully analyze the transition from an initial transient to a post-transient phase that is well described by an analytically-known diffusion solution. We discuss the properties of the numerical solution when rendered in moving-puncture coordinates.

authors: Tania E. Medina-Torrejon, Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino, Luis H.S. Kadowaki, Grzegorz Kowal, Chandra B. Singh, Yosuke Mizuno
topic: Particle acceleration in magnetized relativistic jets still puzzles theorists, specially when one tries to explain the highly variable emission observed in blazar jets or gamma-ray bursts putting severe constraints on current models. In this work we investigate the acceleration of particles injected in a three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical jet subject to current driven kink instability (CDKI), which drives turbulence and fast magnetic reconnection. Test protons injected in the nearly stationary snapshots of the jet, experience an exponential acceleration up to a maximum energy. The simulations also reveal a clear association of the accelerated particles with the regions of fast reconnection. In the early stages of the development of the non-linear growth of CDKI in the jet, when there are still no sites of fast reconnection, injected particles are also efficiently accelerated, but by magnetic curvature drift in the wiggling jet spine. However, they have to be injected with an initial energy much larger than that required for particles to accelerate in reconnection sites. Finally, we have also obtained from the simulations an acceleration time due to reconnection with a weak dependence on the particles energy E.

title: Evolution of inspiralling neutron star binaries: effects of tidal interactions and orbital eccentricities
authors: Jie-Shuang Wang, Dong Lai
topic: Neutron star (NS) binaries formed dynamically may have significant eccentricities while emitting gravitational waves (GWs) in the LIGO/VIRGO band. We study tidal effects in such eccentric inspiralling NS binaries using a set of hybrid equations. The NS is modelled as a compressible ellipsoid, which can deform nonlinearly due to tidal forces, while the orbit evolution is treated with the post-Newtonian (PN) theory up to 2.5-PN order. We find that in general, the tidal interaction can accelerate the inspiral, and cause orbital frequency and phase shifts. For circular inspirals, our calculations reproduce previous linear result at large binary separations, but incorporate the dynamical response of the NS at small separations. For eccentric inspirals, the frequency and phase shifts oscillate considerably near pericenter passages, and the oscillating amplitudes increase with eccentricities.

title: Persistent mysteries of jet engines, formation, propagation, and particle acceleration: have they been addressed experimentally?
authors: Eric G. Blackman, Sergey V. Lebedev
topic: The physics of astrophysical jets can be divided into three regimes: (i) engine and launch (ii) propagation and collimation, (iii) dissipation and particle acceleration. Since astrophysical jets comprise a huge range of scales and phenomena, practicality dictates that most studies of jets intentionally or inadvertently focus on one of these regimes, and even therein, one body of work may be simply boundary condition for another. We first discuss long standing persistent mysteries that pertain the physics of each of these regimes, independent of the method used to study them. This discussion makes contact with frontiers of plasma astrophysics more generally. While observations theory, and simulations, and have long been the main tools of the trade, what about laboratory experiments? Jet related experiments have offered controlled studies of specific principles, physical processes, and benchmarks for numerical and theoretical calculations. We discuss what has been done to date on these fronts. Although experiments have indeed helped us to understand certain processes, proof of principle concepts, and benchmarked codes, they have yet to solved an astrophysical jet mystery on their own

title: Impact of magnetic field on neutrino-matter interactions in core-collapse supernova
authors: Takami Kuroda
topic: We explore the impact of magnetic field on neutrino-matter interactions in core-collapse supernova. We first derive the modified source terms for neutrino-nucleon scattering and neutrino absorption and emission processes in the moment formalism. Then we perform full relativistic three-dimensional, magnetorotational core-collapse supernova simulations of a 20 Msun star with spectral neutrino transport. Our simulations treat self-consistently the parity violation effects of magnetic field on the lepton number, energy, and momentum exchanges. The result shows a clear global asymmetry with respect to the equatorial plane in each exchange rate. The asymmetric property arises from two factors: the angle between the neutrino flux and magnetic field and the term, which is parallel to the magnetic field and is also proportional to the deviation of distribution function of neutrinos from thermal equilibrium. The typical correction value amounts to ~1 % relative to the total neutrino-matter interaction rate for the magnetic field strength of ~10 15-16 G

title: Turbulent magnetic-field amplification in the first 10 milliseconds after a binary neutron star merger: comparing high-resolution and large eddy simulations
authors: Ricard Aguilera-Miret, Daniele Viganò, Federico Carrasco, Borja Miñano, Carlos Palenzuela
topic: The detection of binary neutron star mergers represents one of the most important and complex astrophysical discoveries of the recent years. One of the unclear aspects of the problem is the turbulent magnetic field amplification, initially triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at much smaller scales than any reachable numerical resolution nowadays. Here we present numerical simulations of the first ten milliseconds of a binary neutron star merger. First, we confirm in detail how the simulated amplification depends on the numerical resolution and is distributed on a broad range of scales, as expected from turbulent MHD theory. We find that an initial large-scale magnetic field of 10^11G inside each star is amplified in the remnant to root-mean-square values above 1016G within the first 5 milliseconds for our highest-resolution run. Then, we run large eddy simulations, exploring the performance of the subgrid-scale gradient model, already tested successfully in previous turbulent box simulations. We show that the addition of this model is especially important in the induction equation, since it leads to an amplification of the magnetic field comparable to a higher-resolution run, but with a greatly reduced computational cost. In the first 10 milliseconds, there is no clear hint for an ordered, large-scale magnetic field, which should indeed occur in longer timescales through magnetic winding and the magneto-rotational instability.

title: On the torque exerted by a warped, magnetically threaded accretion disk
authors: Chang Liu, Xiang-Dong Li
topic: Most astrophysical accretion disks are likely to be warped. In X-ray binaries the spin evolution of an accreting neutron star is critically dependent on the interaction between the neutron star magnetic field and the accretion disk. There have been extensive investigations on the accretion torque exerted by a coplanar disk that is magnetically threaded by the magnetic field lines from the neutron stars, but relevant works on warped/tilted accretion disks are still lacking. In this paper we develop a simplified two-component model, in which the disk is comprised of an inner coplanar part and an outer, tilted part. Based on standard assumption on the formation and evolution of the toroidal magnetic field component, we derive the dimensionless torque and show that a warped/titled disk is more likely to spin up the neutron star compared with a coplanar disk.We also discuss the possible influence of various initial parameters on the torque.

title: Formation of Binary Black Hole Similar to GW190521 with a Total Mass of ~150Msun from Population III Binary Star Evolution 
authors: Tomoya Kinugawa, Takashi Nakamura, Hiroyuki Nakano
topic: n case of zero metal (population III) stars, we show that total mass of binary black holes from binary population III star evolution can be ~150Msun, which agrees with mass of a binary black hole, GW190521 recently discovered by LIGO/Virgo. The event rate of such binary black hole mergers is estimated as 0.13--0.66 yr-1 Gpc-3, which is consistent with the observed value of 0.02--0.43 yr-1 Gpc-3.

title: Model Light Curves for Type Ib and Ic Supernovae
authors: Stan Woosley, Tuguldur Sukhbold, Daniel Kasen
topic: Using the Monte Carlo code, SEDONA, multiband photometry and spectra are calculated for supernovae derived from stripped helium stars with presupernova masses from 2.2 to 10.0 Msun. The models are representative of evolution in close binaries. A subset, those with presupernova masses in the range, have many properties in common with observed Type Ib and Ic supernovae, including a median ejected mass near... These limits are fainter than some allegedly typical Type Ib and Ic supernovae and could reflect problems in our models or the observational analysis. Helium stars with lower and higher masses also produce interesting transients that may have been observed including fast, faint, blue transients and long, red, faint Type Ic supernovae. New models are specifically presented for SN 2007Y, SN 2007gr, SN 2009jf, LSQ13abf, SN 2008D, and SN 2010X.

title: On the investigation of the closure relations for Gamma-Ray Bursts observed by Swift in the post-plateau phase and the GRB fundamental plane
authors: Gokul Prem Srinivasaragavan, Maria Giovanna Dainotti, Nissim Fraija, Xavier Hernandez, Shigehiro Nagataki, Luke Bowden, Robert Wagner, Aleksander Lenart
topic: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most explosive phenomena in the Universe after the Big Bang. A large fraction of GRB lightcurves (LCs) shows X-ray plateaus. We perform the most comprehensive analysis of all GRBs (with known and unknown redshifts) with plateau emission observed by The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from its launch until August 2019. We fit 455 LCs showing a plateau and explore whether these LCs follow closure relations, relations between the temporal and spectral indices of the afterglow, corresponding to 2 distinct astrophysical environments and cooling regimes within the external forward shock (ES) model, and find that the ES model works for the majority of cases. The most favored environments are a constant density interstellar or wind medium with slow cooling. We also confirm the existence of the fundamental plane relation between the rest-frame time and luminosity at the end of the plateau emission and the peak prompt luminosity for this enlarged sample, and test this relation on groups corresponding to the astrophysical environments of our known redshift sample. The plane becomes a crucial discriminant corresponding to these environments in terms of the best fitting parameters and dispersions. Most GRBs for which the closure relations are fulfilled with respect to astrophysical environments have an intrinsic scatter sigma compatible within 1 sigma of that of the Gold GRBs, a subset of long GRBs with relatively flat plateaus. We also find that GRBs satisfying closure relations indicating a fast cooling regime have a lower sigma than ever previously found in literature.

title: Black hole - neutron star mergers: the first mass gap and kilonovae
authors: P. Drozda, K. Belczynski, R. O'Shaughnessy, T. Bulik, C.L. Fryer
topic: Observations of X-ray binaries indicate a dearth of compact objects in the mass range from ~2-5 Msun and the existence of this (first mass) gap has been used to advance our understanding of the engines behind core-collapse supernovae. LIGO/Virgo observations provide an independent measure of binary compact remnant masses and several candidate first mass gap objects (either NS or BH) were observed in the O3 science run. We study the formation of BH-NS mergers in the framework of isolated classical binary evolution. We use population synthesis method to evolve binary stars (Population I and II) across cosmic time. We find that with appropriate constraints on the (delayed) supernova engine ~30-40% of LIGO/Virgo BH-NS mergers may host at least one compact object in the gap. The uncertainties in the processes behind compact object formation imply that the fraction of BH-NS systems ejecting mass during the merger is ~0-9%. In our reference we find that only ~0.2% of BH-NS mergers will have any mass ejection, and about the same percentage would produce kilonova bright enough to have a chance to be detected even with a large (Subaru-class) 8m telescope. Interestingly, all these mergers will have both BH and NS in the first mass gap.

title: Is GW190521 the merger of black holes from the first stellar generations?
authors: Eoin J. Farrell, Jose H. Groh, Raphael Hirschi, Laura Murphy, Etienne Kaiser, Sylvia Ekström, Cyril Georgy, Georges Meynet
topic: GW190521 challenges our understanding of the late-stage evolution of massive stars and the effects of the pair-instability in particular. We discuss the possibility that stars at low or zero metallicity could retain most of their hydrogen envelope until the pre-supernova stage, avoid the pulsational pair-instability regime and produce a black hole with a mass in the mass gap by fallback. Models with a metallicity in the range 0-0.0004 have three properties which favour higher BH masses as compared to higher metallicity models. These are (i) lower mass-loss rates during the post-MS phase, (ii) a more compact star disfavouring binary interaction and (iii) possible H-He shell interactions which lower the CO core mass. We conclude that it is possible that GW190521 may be the merger of black holes produced directly by massive stars from the first stellar generations.

title: The Sobolev approximation for radiation transport with line overlap and continuous opacity
authors: Aleksandr Nesterenok
topic: The radiation transport problem in the plane-parallel medium with the large velocity gradient is considered. The Sobolev approximation is used. The effects of continuum absorption and line overlap are taken into account. The photon loss probability functions are calculated and tabulated. Two calculations are performed - for the Gaussian spectral line profile and for the rectangular profile. It is shown that at particular choice of the rectangular profile width the results of the calculations are very close. The evaluated photon loss probability functions may be used in the calculations of energy level populations of OH molecule in the interstellar gas flows.

title: Merging strangeon stars: the ejecta and light curves
authors: X. Y. Lai, C. J. Xia, Y. W. Yu, R. X. Xu
topic: This paper gives the first qualitative description about the evolution of ejecta and find that the ejecta could end up with two components. In the hot environment of the merger, the strangeon nuggets ejected by tidal disruption and hydrodynamical squeezing would suffer from evaporation, in which process particles, such as strangeons, neutrons and protons, are emitted. Taking into account both the evaporation of strangeon nuggets and the decay of strangeons, most of the ejected strangeon nuggets would turn into neutrons and protons within 10 ms, and the dependence of evaporation rate on temperature leads to the two-component ejecta. Light curves are derived for both high and low opacity components, where the former would be ejected from the directions around the equatorial plane, and the latter would be ejected in a broad range of angular directions.

authors: Christian Drischler, Sophia Han, James M. Lattimer, Madappa Prakash, Sanjay Reddy, Tianqi Zhao
topic: We combine equation of state of dense matter up to twice nuclear saturation density (nsat=0.16fm-3) obtained using chiral effective field theory (xEFT), and recent observations of neutron stars to gain insights about the high-density matter encountered in their cores. A key element in our study is the recent Bayesian analysis of correlated EFT truncation errors based on order-by-order calculations up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in the χEFT expansion. We refine the bounds on the maximum mass imposed by causality at high densities, and provide stringent limits on the maximum and minimum radii of ~1.4Msun and ~2.0Msun stars.

title: Don't fall into the gap: GW190521 as a straddling binary
authors: Maya Fishbach, Daniel E. Holz
topic: black holes cannot be born with masses in the range 50Msun less m less 120Msun. The reported mass of GW190521's primary black hole, falls squarely within this mass gap. We consider the more conservative alternative that GW190521's secondary BH belongs to the population of BHs previously observed by LIGO/Virgo With this prior on m2, we automatically find that the mass of the primary BH has. This is because the total mass of the system is better constrained than the individual masses. As long as the prior odds for a double-mass-gap BBH are smaller than ~1:15, it is more likely that GW190521 straddles the PISN gap.

authors: V. Gayathri, J. Healy, J. Lange, B. O'Brien, M. Szczepanczyk, I. Bartos, M. Campanelli, S. Klimenko, C. Lousto, R. O'Shaughnessy
topic: The stellar-mass black hole merger GW190521 is the heaviest system discovered by LIGO/Virgo so far, with masses unexpected from stellar evolution. The system underwent precession due to its black hole spin orientation, a signature of binaries formed through gravitational capture. Capture through close encounters can also lead to eccentric binary orbits, but this feature is currently difficult to identify due to the lack of suitable gravitational waveforms. No eccentric merger has been reported to date. Here we show that GW190521 is the most consistent with a highly eccentric black hole merger. We carried out 325 numerical relativity simulations to generate an effective ~3x10^4 gravitational waveforms to compare to the observed data, much greater than previously available at high eccentricities. We find that GW190521 is best explained by a high-eccentricity, precessing model with e~0.7. All properties of GW190521 point to its origin being the repeated gravitational capture of black holes, making GW190521 the first of LIGO/Virgo's discoveries whose formation channel is identified.

title: On the Origin of GW190521-like events from repeated black hole mergers in star clusters
authors: Giacomo Fragione, Abraham Loeb, Frederic A. Rasio
topic: LIGO and Virgo have reported the detection of GW190521, from the merger of a binary black hole (BBH) with a total mass around 150 Msun. While current stellar models limit the mass of any black hole (BH) remnant to about 40-50 Msun, more massive BHs can be produced dynamically through repeated mergers in the core of a dense star cluster. The process is limited by the recoil kick (due to anisotropic emission of gravitational radiation) imparted to merger remnants, which can escape the parent cluster, thereby terminating growth. We study the role of the host cluster metallicity and escape speed in the buildup of massive BHs through repeated mergers. Almost independent of host metallicity, we find that a BBH of about 150 Msun could be formed dynamically in any star cluster

authors: Juan Calderón Bustillo, Nicolas Sanchis-Gual, Alejandro Torres-Forné, José A. Font, Avi Vajpeyi, Rory Smith, Carlos Herdeiro, Eugen Radu, Samson H. W. Leong
topic: dvanced LIGO-Virgo reported a short gravitational-wave signal (GW190521) interpreted as a quasi-circular merger of black holes, one populating the pair-instability supernova gap, forming a remnant black hole of Mf~142Msun at a luminosity distance of dL~5.3 Gpc. With barely visible pre-merger emission, however, GW190521 merits further investigation of the pre-merger dynamics and even of the very nature of the colliding objects. We show that GW190521 is consistent with numerically simulated signals from head-on collisions of two (equal mass and spin) horizonless vector boson stars (aka Proca stars), forming a final black hole with Mf=231+13-17Msun, located at a distance of dL=571+348-181 Mpc. The favoured mass for the ultra-light vector boson constituent of the Proca stars is muV=8.72+0.73-0.82x10-13 eV. This provides the first demonstration of close degeneracy between these two theoretical models, for a real gravitational-wave event. Confirmation of the Proca star interpretation, which we find statistically slightly preferred, would provide the first evidence for a long sought dark matter particle.

title: Hyperon Bulk Viscosity in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Mark G. Alford, Alexander Haber
topic: In this paper we present a computation of bulk viscosity arising from hyperonic processes in matter at densities and temperatures typical of neutron star mergers. To deal with the high temperatures in this environment we go beyond the Fermi surface approximation in our rate calculations and numerically evaluate the full phase space integral. We include processes where quarks move between baryons via meson exchange: these have been largely omitted in previous analyses but provide the dominant contribution to the bulk viscosity. We obtain the dissipation times for harmonic oscillations at the frequencies seen in merger simulations, and find that hyperon bulk viscosity can be highly relevant at densities just below the onset of the first hyperon species and temperatures up to T=5 MeV, with dissipation times as fast as τdiss approx 9 ms.

title: Deformed crystals and torsional oscillations of neutron star crust
authors: A. A. Kozhberov, D. G. Yakovlev
topic: We study breaking stress of deformed Coulomb crystals in a neutron star crust, taking into account electron plasma screening of ion-ion interaction; calculated breaking stress is fitted as a function of electron screening parameter. We apply the results for analyzing torsional oscillation modes in the crust of a non-magnetic star. We present exact analytic expression for the fundamental frequencies of such oscillations and show that the frequencies of all torsional oscillations are insensitive to the presence of the outer neutron star crust. The results can be useful in theoretical modeling of processes involving deformed Coulomb crystals in the crust of neutron stars, such as magnetic field evolution, torsional crustal or thermo-elastic quasi-periodic oscillations of flaring soft gamma-ray repeaters, pulsar glitches. The applicability of the results to soft gamma-ray repeaters is discussed.

title: GW190521: orbital eccentricity and signatures of dynamical formation in a binary black hole merger signal
authors: Isobel M. Romero-Shaw, Paul D. Lasky, Eric Thrane, Juan Calderon Bustillo
topic: Pair instability supernovae are thought to restrict the formation of black holes in the mass range -50 - 135 solar masses. However, black holes with masses within this "high mass gap" are expected to form as the remnants of binary black hole mergers. These remnants can merge again dynamically in densely populated environments such as globular clusters. The hypothesis that the binary black hole merger GW190521 formed dynamically is supported by its high mass. Orbital eccentricity can also be a signature of dynamical formation, since a binary that merges quickly after becoming bound may not circularize before merger. In this work, we measure the orbital eccentricity of GW190521.

title: Constraining the Jet Launching Time of GRB 170817A by Utilizing the Baryon Loading
authors: Jia Ren, Da-Bin Lin, Lu-lu Zhang, Kai Wang, Xiao-yan Li, Xiang-Gao Wang, En-Wei Liang
topic: The observed delay of GRB 170817A relative to GW170817 carries significant information about gamma-ray burst (GRB) physics and is subject to intense debate. In this letter, we put forward an approach to discuss the major source of this time delay. First of all, we use the structured jet model to fit the X-ray/optical/radio afterglows of GRB 170817A together with superluminal motion measured by the Very Long Baseline Interferometry. Our structured jet is modelled with angle-dependent energy and baryon loading. It is found that our model can well fit the afterglows of GRB 170817A. After that, the baryon loading in the jet is inferred based on our fitting results. By comparing the baryon loading to the mass outflow in different stages, we infer that the time lag of the jet launch relative to the merger is less than hundreds or tens of milliseconds. It suggests that the time delay of GRB 170817A relative to GW170817 is defined mostly by the spreading time of the jet propagating to its dissipation radius.

title: Multi-messenger parameter estimation of GW170817: from jet structure to the Hubble constant
authors: Hao Wang, Dimitrios Giannios
topic: The electromagnetic radiation that followed the neutron-star merger event GW170817 revealed that gamma-ray burst afterglows from jets misaligned with our line of sight exhibit a light curve with slowly rising flux. The slope of the rising light curve depends sensitively on the angle of the observer with respect to the jet axis, which is likely to be perpendicular to the merger plane of the neutron star binary. Therefore, the afterglow emission can be used to constrain the inclination of the merging system. Here, we calculate the GRB afterglow emission based on the realistic jet structure derived from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations of black hole-torus system for the central engine of the gamma-ray burst. Combined with gravitational wave parameter estimation, we fit the multi-epoch afterglow emission of GW170817. We show that with such a jet model, the observing angle can be tightly constrained by multi-messenger observations. The best fit observing angle of GW170817 is Theta_nu=0.38pm0.02 rad. With such a constraint, we can break the degeneracy between inclination angle and luminosity distance in gravitational wave parameter estimation, and substantially increase the precision with which the Hubble constant is constrained by the standard siren method. Our estimation of the distance...  As a result, multi-messenger observations of short-duration gamma-ray bursts, combined with a good theoretical understanding of the jet structure, can be powerful probes of cosmological parameters.

title: 3D modelling of magneto-thermal evolution of neutron stars: method and test cases
authors: Davide De Grandis, Roberto Turolla, Toby S. Wood, Silvia Zane, Roberto Taverna, Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos
topic: Neutron stars harbour extremely strong magnetic fields within their solid outer crust. The topology of this field strongly influences the surface temperature distribution, and hence the star's observational properties. In this work, we present the first realistic simulations of the coupled crustal magneto-thermal evolution of isolated neutron stars in three dimensions with account for neutrino emission, obtained with the pseudo-spectral code Parody. We investigate both the secular evolution, especially in connection with the onset of instabilities during the Hall phase, and the short-term evolution following episodes of localised energy injection. Simulations show that a resistive tearing instability develops in about a Hall time if the initial toroidal field exceeds similar 10^15 G. This leads to crustal failures because of the huge magnetic stresses coupled with the local temperature enhancement produced by dissipation. Localised heat deposition in the crust results in the appearance of hot spots on the star surface which can exhibit a variety of patterns. Since the transport properties are strongly influenced by the magnetic field, the hot regions tend to drift away and get deformed following the magnetic field lines while cooling. The shapes obtained with our simulations are reminiscent of those recently derived from NICER X-ray observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR J0030+0451.

title: Maximum mass cutoff in the neutron star mass distribution and the prospect of forming supramassive objects in the double neutron star mergers
authors: Dong-Sheng Shao, Shao-Peng Tang, Jin-Liang Jiang, Yi-Zhong Fan
topic: The sample of neutron stars with a measured mass is growing quickly. With the latest sample, we adopt both a flexible Gaussian mixture model and a Gaussian plus Cauchy-Lorentz component model to infer the mass distribution of neutron stars and use the Bayesian model selection to explore evidence for multimodality and a sharp cutoff in the mass distribution. The two models yield rather similar results. Consistent with previous studies, we find evidence for a bimodal distribution together with a cutoff at a mass. If such a cutoff is interpreted as the maximum gravitational mass of nonrotating cold neutron stars, the prospect of forming supramassive remnants is found to be quite promising for the double neutron star mergers with a total gravitational mass less than or equal to 2.7Msun unless the thermal pions could substantially soften the equation of state for the very hot neutron star matter. These supramassive remnants have a typical kinetic rotational energy of approximately.

title: Fast neutrino flavor conversion, ejecta properties, and nucleosynthesis in newly-formed hypermassive remnants of neutron-star mergers
authors: Manu George, Meng-Ru Wu, Irene Tamborra, Ricard Ardevol-Pulpillo, Hans-Thomas Janka
topic: Neutrinos emitted in the coalescence of two neutron stars affect the dynamics of the outflow ejecta and the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. In this work, we analyze the neutrino emission properties and the conditions leading to the growth of flavor instabilities in merger remnants consisting of a hypermassive neutron star and an accretion disk during the first 10 ms after the merger. The analyses are based on hydrodynamical simulations that include a modeling of neutrino emission and absorption effects via the "Improved Leakage-Equilibration-Absorption Scheme" (ILEAS). We also examine the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements via the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) inside the material ejected during this phase. The dominant emission of nue^- over nue from the merger remnant leads to favorable conditions for the occurrence of fast pairwise flavor conversions of neutrinos, independent of the chosen equation of state or the mass ratio of the binary. The nucleosynthesis outcome is very robust, ranging from the first to the third r-process peaks. In particular, more than 10-5 Msun of strontium are produced in these early ejecta that may account for the GW170817 kilonova observation. We find that the amount of ejecta containing free neutrons after the r-process freeze-out, which may power early-time UV emission, is reduced by roughly a factor of 10 when compared to simulations that do not include weak interactions. Finally, the potential flavor equipartition between all neutrino flavors is mainly found to affect the nucleosynthesis outcome in the polar ejecta within 30 degrees by changing the amount of the produced iron-peak and first-peak nuclei, but it does not alter the lanthanide mass fraction therein.

topic: gamma -ray bursts (GRBs) are short-lived transients releasing a large amount of energy (1051−1053erg) in the keV-MeV energy range. GRBs are thought to originate from internal dissipation of the energy carried by ultra-relativistic jets launched by the remnant of a massive star′s death or a compact binary coalescence. While thousands of GRBs have been observed over the last thirty years, we still have an incomplete understanding of where and how the radiation is generated in the jet. A novel investigation of the GRB emission mechanism, via time-resolved spectral analysis of the X-ray tails of bright GRB pulses, enables us to discover a unique relation between the spectral index and the flux. This relation is incompatible with the long standing scenario invoked to interpret X-ray tails, that is, the delayed arrival of photons from high-latitude parts of the jet. We show that our results provide for the first time evidence of adiabatic cooling and efficient energy exchange between the emitting particles in the relativistic outflows of GRBs.

title: The cosmic merger rate density of compact objects: impact of star formation, metallicity, initial mass function and binary evolution
authors: Filippo Santoliquido, Michela Mapelli, Nicola Giacobbo, Yann Bouffanais, M. Celeste Artale
topic: We evaluate the redshift distribution of binary black hole (BBH), black hole - neutron star binary (BHNS) and binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, exploring the main sources of uncertainty: star formation rate (SFR) density, metallicity evolution, common envelope, mass transfer via Roche lobe overflow, natal kicks, core-collapse supernova model and initial mass function. Among binary evolution processes, uncertainties on common envelope ejection have a major impact: the local merger rate density of BNSs varies from sim10^3 to sim20 Gpc-3 yr-1 if we change the common envelope efficiency parameter from alphaCE=7 to 0.5, while the local merger rates of BBHs and BHNSs vary by a factor of sim2-3. The BBH merger rate changes by one order of magnitude, when 1sigma uncertainties on metallicity evolution are taken into account. In contrast, the BNS merger rate is almost insensitive to metallicity. Hence, BNSs are the ideal test bed to put constraints on uncertain binary evolution processes, such as common envelope and natal kicks. Our BNS models match the cosmic merger rate inferred from LIGO - Virgo data only for large values of alphaCE (greater 3) and only if the magnitude of natal kicks scales with the mass of the ejecta.

title: Structured, relativistic jets driven by radiation
authors: Eric R. Coughlin, Mitchell C. Begelman
topic: Relativistic jets, or highly collimated and fast-moving outflows, are endemic to many astrophysical phenomena. The jets produced by gamma-ray bursts and tidal disruption events are accompanied by the accretion of material onto a black hole or neutron star, with the accretion rate exceeding the Eddington limit of the compact object by orders of magnitude. In such systems, radiation dominates the energy-momentum budget of the outflow, and the dynamical evolution of the jet is governed by the equations of radiation hydrodynamics. Here we show that there are analytic solutions to the equations of radiation hydrodynamics in the viscous (i.e., diffusive) regime that describe structured, relativistic jets, which consist of a fast-moving, highly relativistic core surrounded by a slower-moving, less relativistic sheath. In these solutions, the slower-moving, outer sheath contains most of the mass, and the jet structure is mediated by local anisotropies in the radiation field. We show that, depending on the pressure and density profile of the ambient medium, the angular profile of the jet Lorentz factor is Gaussian or falls off even more steeply with angle. These solutions have implications for the nature of jet production and evolution in hyperaccreting systems, and demonstrate that such jets -- and the corresponding jet structure -- can be sustained entirely by radiative processes. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of jetted tidal disruption events and short and long gamma-ray bursts.

title: Viscous evolution of a massive disk surrounding stellar-mass black holes in full general relativity
authors: Sho Fujibayashi, Masaru Shibata, Shinya Wanajo, Kenta Kiuchi, Koutarou Kyutoku, Yuichiro Sekiguchi
topic: Long-term viscous neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations in full general relativity are performed for a massive disk surrounding spinning stellar-mass black holes with mass MBH=4, 6, and 10Msun and initial dimensionless spin χ=0.8. The initial disk is chosen to have mass Mdisk=0.1 or 3Msun as plausible models of the remnants for the merger of black hole-neutron star binaries or the stellar core collapse from a rapidly rotating progenitor, respectively. For Mdisk=0.1Msun with the outer disk edge initially located at rout similar 200 km, we find that 15%-20% of Mdisk is ejected and the average electron fraction of the ejecta is Ye=0.30-0.35 as found in the previous study. For Mdisk=3Msun, we find that =10%-20% of Mdisk is ejected for rout=200-1000 km. In addition, Ye of the ejecta can be enhanced to be greater then 0.4 because the electron fraction is increased significantly during the long-term viscous expansion of the disk with high neutrino luminosity until the mass ejection sets in. Our results suggest that not heavy r-process elements but light trans-iron elements would be synthesized in the matter ejected from a massive torus surrounding stellar-mass black holes. We also find that the outcomes of the viscous evolution for the high-mass disk case is composed of a rapidly spinning black hole surrounded by a torus with a narrow funnel, which appears to be suitable for generating gamma-ray bursts.

topic: With the black hole mass function (BHMF; assuming an exponential cutoff at a mass of 40Msun) of coalescing binary black hole systems constructed with the events detected in the O1 run of the advanced LIGO/Virgo network, Liang et al.(2017) predicted that the birth of the lightest intermediate mass black holes (LIMBHs; with a final mass of less 100Msun) is very likely to be caught by the advanced LIGO/Virgo detectors in their O3 run. The O1 and O2 observation run data, however, strongly favor a cutoff of the BHMF much sharper than the exponential one. In this work we show that a power-law function followed by a sudden drop at 40Msun by a factor of a few tens and then a new power-law component extending to less 100Msun are consistent with the O1 and O2 observation run data. With this new BHMF, quite a few LIMBH events can be detected in the O3 observation run of advanced LIGO/Virgo. The first LIMBH born in GW190521, an event detected in the early stage of the O3 run of advanced LIGO/Virgo network, provides additional motivation for our hypothesis.

title: Statistical study of gamma-ray bursts with jet break feature in multi-wavelength afterglow emissions
authors: Wen Zhao, Jia-Chang Zhang, Qing-Xiang Zhang, Jian-Tong Liang, Xiao-Hang Luan, Qi-Qi Zhou, Shuang-Xi Yi, Fei-Fei Wang, Shao-Tong Zhang
topic: It is generally supposed that a transition from the normal decay phase (decay slope -1) to a steeper phase (decay slope -2) could be suggested as a jet break. The jet opening angle Theta jet is then calculated from the jet break time of the afterglow light curve. This allows the derivation of the collimation-corrected energy E jet of those GRBs. We extensively searched for the GRBs with jet break features from multi-wavelength afterglow light curves, and 138 GRBs with significant breaks were collected. The jet break times of those GRBs mainly range from 1000 s to 106 s, and the distribution of the collimation-corrected energy Ejet peaks at 10 to the power 50 erg.

authors: Yunfei Xu, Dong Xu, Chenzhou Cui, Dongwei Fan, Zipei Zhu, Bangyao Yu, Changhua Li, Jun Han, Linying Mi, Shanshan Li, Boliang He, Yihan Tao, Hanxi Yang, Sisi Yang
topic: The search and follow-up observation of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of gravitational waves (GW) is a current hot topic of GW cosmology. Due to the limitation of the accuracy of the GW observation facility at this stage, we can only get a rough sky-localization region for the GW event, and the typical area of the region is between 200 and 1500 square degrees. Since GW events occur in or near galaxies, limiting the observation target to galaxies can significantly speedup searching for EM counterparts. Therefore, how to efficiently select host galaxy candidates in such a large GW localization region, how to arrange the observation sequence, and how to efficiently identify the GW source from observational data are the problems that need to be solved. International Virtual Observatory Alliance has developed a series of technical standards for data retrieval, interoperability and visualization. Based on the application of VO technologies, we construct the GW follow-up Observation Planning System (GWOPS).

title: Connections between Non-Rotating, Slowly Rotating, and Rapidly Rotating Turbulent Convection Transport Scalings
authors: Jonathan M. Aurnou, Susanne Horn, Keith Julien
topic: Buoyancy-driven convection is likely the dominant driver of turbulent motions in the universe, and thus, is widely studied by physicists, engineers, geophysicists and astrophysicists. Maybe unsurprisingly, these different communities discuss the gross convective behaviors in different ways, often without significant cross-talk existing between them. Here, we seek to draw connections between these communities. We do so by carrying out a set of basic scale estimations for how heat and fluid momentum transport should behave in non-rotating, slowly rotating and rapidly rotating buoyancy-driven convective environments. We find that slowly and rapidly rotating scalings can be inter-related via one parameter, the so-called convective Rossby number dissipation-free parameter measuring the importance of buoyancy driving relative to rotation. Further, we map between non-flux-based and the flux-based, buoyancy-driven scalings used by different groups. In doing so, these scalings show that there are clean connections between the different communities' approaches and that a number of the seemingly different scalings are actually synonymous with one another.

title: As a matter of tension -- kinetic energy spectra in MHD turbulence
authors: Philipp Grete, Brian W. O'Shea, Kris Beckwith
topic: Magnetized turbulence is ubiquitous in many astrophysical and terrestrial systems but no complete, uncontested theory even in the simplest form, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), exists. Many theories and phenomenologies focus on the joint (kinetic and magnetic) energy fluxes and spectra. We highlight the importance of treating kinetic and magnetic energies separately to shed light on MHD turbulence dynamics. We conduct an implicit large eddy simulation of subsonic, super-Alfvenic MHD turbulence and analyze the scale-wise energy transfer over time. Our key finding is that the kinetic energy spectrum develops a scaling in the stationary regime as the kinetic energy cascade is suppressed by magnetic tension. This motivates a reevaluation of existing MHD turbulence theories with respect to a more differentiated modeling of the energy fluxes.

title: Multi-Dimensional Solution of Fast Neutrino Conversions in Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants
authors: Ian Padilla-Gay, Shashank Shalgar, Irene Tamborra 
topic: Fast pairwise conversions of neutrinos are predicted to be ubiquitous in neutron star merger remnants with potentially major implications on the nucleosynthesis of the elements heavier than iron. We present the first sophisticated numerical solution of the neutrino flavor evolution above the remnant disk within a (2+1+1) dimensional setup: two spatial coordinates, one angular variable, and time. We look for a steady-state flavor configuration above the remnant disk. Albeit the linear stability analysis predicts flavor instabilities at any location above the remnant disk, our simulations in the non-linear regime show that fast pairwise conversions lead to minimal neutrino mixing (less 1 percent) ; flavor equilibration is never achieved in our models. Importantly, fast neutrino conversions are more prominent within localized regions near the edges of the (anti)neutrino decoupling surfaces and almost negligible in the polar region of the remnant. Our findings on the role of fast pairwise conversions should be interpreted with caution because of the approximations intrinsic to our setup and advocate for further work within a more realistic framework.

title: Short duration gamma-ray bursts and their outflows in light of GW170817
authors: Davide Lazzati
topic: The detection of GW170817, it's extensive multi-wavelength follow-up campaign, and the large amount of theoretical development and interpretation that followed, have resulted in a significant step forward in the understanding of the binary neutron star merger phenomenon as a whole. One of its aspects is seeing the merger as a progenitor of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRB), which will be the subject of this review. On the one hand, GW170817 observations have confirmed some theoretical expectations, exemplified by the confirmation that binary neutron star mergers are the progenitors of SGRBs. In addition, the multimessenger nature of GW170817 has allowed for gathering of unprecedented data, such as the trigger time of the merger, the delay with which the gamma-ray photons were detected, and the brightening afterglow of an off-axis event. All together, the incomparable richness of the data from GW170817 has allowed us to paint a fairly detailed picture of at least one SGRB. I will detail what we learned, what new questions have arisen, and the perspectives for answering them when a sample of GW170817-comparable events have been studied.

title: The GW190521 Mass Gap Event and the Primordial Black Hole Scenario
authors: V. De Luca, V. Desjacques, G. Franciolini, P. Pani, A. Riotto
topic: The LIGO/Virgo Collaboration has recently observed GW190521, the first binary black hole merger with at least the primary component mass in the mass gap predicted by the pair-instability supernova theory. This observation disfavors the standard stellar-origin formation scenario for the heavier black hole, motivating alternative hypotheses. We show that GW190521 cannot be explained within the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) scenario if PBHs do not accrete during their cosmological evolution, since this would require an abundance which is already in tension with current constraints. On the other hand, GW190521 may have a primordial origin if PBHs accrete efficiently before the reionization epoch.

title: The influence of line opacity treatment in STELLA on supernova light curves
authors: Alexandra Kozyreva, Luke Shingles, Alexey Mironov, Petr Baklanov, Sergey Blinnikov
topic: We systematically explore the effect of the treatment of line opacity on supernova light curves. We find that it is important to consider line opacity for both scattering and absorption (i.e. thermalisation which mimics the effect of fluorescence.) We explore the impact of degree of thermalisation on three major types of supernovae: Type Ia, Type II-peculiar, and Type II-plateau. For that we use radiative transfer code STELLA and analyse broad-band light curves in the context of simulations done with the spectral synthesis code ARTIS and in the context a few examples of observed supernovae of each type. We found that the plausible range for the ratio between absorption and scattering in the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA is (0.8-1):(0.2-0), i.e. the recommended thermalisation parameter is 0.9.

title: Convectively Driven Three Dimensional Turbulence in Massive Star Envelopes: I. A 1D Implementation of Diffusive Radiative Transport
authors: William Schultz, Lars Bildsten, Yan-Fei Jiang
topic: Massive (M>30Msun) stars exhibit luminosities that are near the Eddington-limit for electron scattering causing the increase in opacity associated with iron at T≈180,000K to trigger supersonic convection in their outer envelopes. Three dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations by Jiang and collaborators with the Athena++ computational tool have found order of magnitude density and radiative flux fluctuations in these convective regions, even at optical depths >> 100. We show here that radiation can diffuse out of a parcel during the timescale of convection in these optically thick parts of the star, motivating our use of a "pseudo" Mach number to characterize both the fluctuation amplitudes and their correlations. In this first paper, we derive the impact of these fluctuations on the radiative pressure gradient needed to carry a given radiative luminosity. This implementation leads to a remarkable improvement between 1D and 3D radiative pressure gradients, and builds confidence in our path to an eventual 1D implementation of these intrinsically 3D envelopes. However, simply reducing the radiation pressure gradient is not enough to implement a new 1D model.

title: The importance of charged particle reactions in the r-process on supernovae and neutron stars
authors: Pedro V. Guillaumon, Iuda D. Goldman
topic: We propose a (p,xn) mechanism with dynamic production as a new set of nuclear reactions that could produce high density neutrons and explain the r- and rp-elements. We calculate the rate of thorium and uranium produced by our proposed mechanism and show that it is compatible with different stellar conditions found in explosive events at an initial temperature of T geq 3*109K with a "freeze-out" by a neutrino-driven wind. We show that charged particle reactions could explain the discrepancies in the abundances of 232Th and 235,238U nucleochronometers. We extend the endpoint of the rapid proton (rp) process far beyond the previous work by showing that (p,xn) reactions could contribute to the nucleosynthesis of heavy stable neutron deficient nuclides. This implies in a broader definition of the rp-process and has important consequences for the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. We show that we did not need to assume an extreme condition for the drip line of super neutron-rich nuclei.

title: Properties and astrophysical implications of the 150 Msun binary black hole merger GW190521
authors: The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration
topic: The gravitational-wave signal GW190521 is consistent with a binary black hole merger source at redshift 0.8 with unusually high component masses, 85+21-14Msun and 66+17-18Msun, compared to previously reported events, and shows mild evidence for spin-induced orbital precession. The primary falls in the mass gap predicted by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova theory, in the approximate range 65−120Msun. The probability that at least one of the black holes in GW190521 is in that range is 99.0%. The final mass of the merger (142+28-16Msun) classifies it as an intermediate-mass black hole. Under the assumption of a quasi-circular binary black hole coalescence, we detail the physical properties of GW190521's source binary and its post-merger remnant, including component masses and spin vectors. Three different waveform models, as well as direct comparison to numerical solutions of general relativity, yield consistent estimates of these properties. Tests of strong-field general relativity targeting the merger-ringdown stages of coalescence indicate consistency of the observed signal with theoretical predictions. We estimate the merger rate. We discuss the astrophysical implications of GW190521 for stellar collapse, and for the possible formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass gap through various channels: via (multiple) stellar coalescence, or via hierarchical merger of lower-mass black holes in star clusters or in active galactic nuclei. We find it to be unlikely that GW190521 is a strongly lensed signal of a lower-mass black hole binary merger. We also discuss more exotic possible sources for GW190521, including a highly eccentric black hole binary, or a primordial black hole binary.

title: GW190814: Circumstantial Evidence for Up-Down Quark Star
authors: Zheng Cao, Lie-Wen Chen, Peng-Cheng Chu, Ying Zhou
topic: Within a confining quark matter model which considers phenomenologically the quark confinement and asymptotic freedom as well as the chiral symmetry restoration and quark deconfinement at high baryon density, we find that if the up-down quark matter (udQM) is more stable than nuclear matter and strange quark matter (SQM), the maximum mass of static quark stars with udQM is 2.77Msun under agreement with both the constraints on star tidal deformability from gravitational wave signal GW170817 and the mass-radius of PSR J0030+045 measured simultaneously by NICER. In contrast, the conventional strange quark star with SQM has a maximum static mass of only 2.05Msun and its radius significantly deviates from NICER's constraint. Our results thus provide circumstantial evidence suggesting the recently reported GW190814's secondary component with a mass of 2.59+0.08-0.09Msun could be an up-down quark star.

In this letter we propose several explanations based on models of new physics, including new light particle losses, modified gravity, large extra dimensions, and a small magnetic moment of the neutrino. Each of these affect the physics of the pair-instability differently, leading to novel mechanisms for forming black holes inside the black hole mass gap.

topic: We present multiwavelength modeling of the afterglow from the long gamma-ray burst GRB 160625B using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques of the afterglowpy Python package. GRB 160625B is an extremely bright burst with a rich set of observations spanning from radio to gamma-ray frequencies. These observations range from ~0.1 days to >1000 days, thus making this event extremely well-suited to such modeling. In this work we compare top-hat and Gaussian jet structure types in order to find best fit values for the GRB jet collimation angle, viewing angle, and other physical parameters. We find that a Gaussian-shaped jet is preferred (2.7-5.3 sigma) over the traditional top-hat model. Our estimate for the opening angle of the burst ranges from 1.26 to 3.90 degrees, depending on jet shape model. We also discuss the implications that assumptions on jet shape, viewing angle, and particularly the participation fraction of electrons have on the final estimation of GRB intrinsic energy release and the resulting energy budget of the relativistic outflow.

title: Combining Electromagnetic and Gravitational-Wave Constraints on Neutron-Star Masses and Radii
authors: Mohammad Al-Mamun, Andrew W. Steiner, Joonas Nattila, Jacob Lange, Richard O'Shaugnessy, Ingo Tews, Stefano Gandolfi, Craig Heinke, Sophia Han
topic: We perform a joint Bayesian inference of neutron-star mass and radius constraints based on GW170817, observations of quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (QLMXBs), photospheric radius expansion X-ray bursts (PREs), and X-ray timing observations of J0030+0451. With this data set, the form of the prior distribution still has an impact on the posterior mass-radius (MR) curves and equation of state (EOS), but this impact is smaller than recently obtained when considering QLMXBs alone. We analyze the consistency of the electromagnetic data by including an "intrinsic scattering" contribution to the uncertainties, and find only a slight broadening of the posteriors. This suggests that the gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations of neutron-star structure are providing a consistent picture of the neutron-star mass-radius curve and the EOS.

title: GRB 200415A: magnetar giant flare or short gamma-ray burst?
authors: Pavel Minaev, Alexei Pozanenko
topic: A detailed analysis of the GBM/Fermi experiment data is carried out to classify GRB 200415A. It is shown that, on the one hand, this event exhibits typical for type I (short) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) properties, such as duration, variability, and the character of spectral evolution (lag). On the other hand, the localization of the event source on the celestial plane, obtained by the triangulation method (IPN), indicates the nearby (DL = 3.5 Mpc) galaxy NGC 253 (Sculptor) as a possible host galaxy for this burst. It introduces significant restrictions on the energetics of the event (Eiso ~ 1046 erg) and gives an alternative interpretation of GRB 200415A as a giant flare (GF) of a soft gamma repeater (SGR). This interpretation is supported by the atypically hard energy spectrum.

topic: The mergers of two neutron stars are typically accompanied by broad-band electromagnetic emission from either a relativistic jet or a kilonova. It has also been long predicted that coherent radio emission will occur during the merger phase or from a newly formed neutron star remnant, however this emission has not been seen to date. This paper presents the deepest limits for this emission from a neutron star merger folowing triggered LOFAR observations of the short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) 181123B, starting 4.4 minutes after the GRB occurred. During the X-ray plateau phase, a signature of ongoing energy injection, we detect no radio emission to a 3σ limit of 153 mJy at 144 MHz, which is significantly fainter to the predicted emission from a standard neutron star. Snapshot images were made of the radio observation on a range of timescales, targeting short duration radio flashes similar to fast radio bursts (FRBs). No emission was detected in the snapshot images at the location of GRB 181123B enabling constraints to be placed on the prompt coherent radio emission model and emission predicted to occur when a neutron star collapses to form a black hole.

title: Lense-Thirring Precession of Misaligned Discs I
authors: Sergei Dyda, Christopher S. Reynolds
topic: We study Lense-Thirring precession of inviscid and viscous misaligned alpha-discs around a black hole using a gravitomagnetic term in the momentum equation. For weak misalignments, i \leq 10~deg, the discs behave like rigid bodies, undergoing the full suite of classical harmonic oscillator dynamics including, weak and critically damped motion (due to viscosity), precession (due to Lense-Thirring torque) and nutation (due to apsidal precession). For strong misalignments, i \geq 30~deg, we find sufficiently thin, h/r \leq 0.05 discs break, form a gap and the inner and outer sub-discs evolve quasi independently apart from slow mass transfer. Assuming the sound speed sets the communication speed of warps in the disc, we can estimate the breaking radius by requiring that the inner sub-disc precesses like a rigid body. We explicitly show for the first time using a grid code that an Einstein potential is needed to reproduce the analytic properties of the inner disc edge and find disc breaking. At large inclination angles we find multiple disc breaks, consistent with recent GRMHD simulations of highly inclined discs. Our results suggest that the inclusion of a gravitomagnetic term and appropriate pseudo-Newtonian potential captures the important quantitative features of misaligned discs.

title: Neutrino Counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Ke Fang, Ben Maraglit
topic: The discovery of a luminous radio burst, FRB 200428, with properties similar to those of fast radio bursts (FRB), in coincidence with an X-ray flare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, supports magnetar models for cosmological FRBs. The burst's X-ray to radio fluence ratio, as well as the X-ray spectral shape and peak energy, are consistent with FRB 200428 being the result of an ultra-relativistic shock (powered, e.g., by an ejected plasmoid) propagating into a magnetized baryon-rich external medium; the shock simultaneously generates X-ray/gamma-rays via thermal synchrotron emission from electrons heated behind the shock, and coherent radio emission via the synchrotron maser mechanism. Here, we point out that a unique consequence of this baryon-loaded shock scenario is the generation of a coincident burst of high-energy neutrinos, generated by photo-hadronic interaction of relativistic ions - heated or accelerated at the shock - with thermal synchrotron photons. We estimate the properties of these neutrino burst FRB counterparts and find that a fraction ~1e-8-1e-5 of the flare energy (or ~1e-4-0.1 of the radio isotropic energy) is channeled into production of neutrinos with typical energies ~ TeV-PeV. We conclude by discussing prospects for detecting this signal with IceCube and future high-energy neutrino detectors.

title: Kinetic Simulations of Cosmic-Ray-Modified Shocks I: Hydrodynamics
authors: Colby C. Haggerty, Damiano Caprioli
topic: Collisionless plasma shocks are efficient sources of non-thermal particle acceleration in space and astrophysical systems. We use hybrid (kinetic ions -- fluid electrons) simulations to examine the non-linear feedback of the self-generated energetic particles (cosmic rays, CRs) on the shock hydrodynamics. When CR acceleration is efficient, we find evidence of both an upstream precursor, where the inflowing plasma is compressed and heated, and a downstream postcursor, where the energy flux in CRs and amplified magnetic fields play a dynamical role. For the first time, we assess how non-linear magnetic fluctuations in the postcursor preferentially travel away from the shock at roughly the local Alfvén speed with respect to the downstream plasma. The drift of both magnetic and CR energy with respect to the thermal plasma substantially increases the shock compression ratio with respect to the standard prediction, in particular exceeding 4 for strong shocks. Such modifications also have implications for the spectrum of the particles accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration, a significant result detailed in a companion paper.

authors: Hanindyo Kuncarayakti, Gaston Folatelli, Keiichi Maeda, Luc Dessart, Anders Jerkstrand, Joseph P. Anderson, Kentaro Aoki, Melina C. Bersten, Lucia Ferrari, et al
topic: The narrow component appears also in other lines, and is conspicuous in [O I]. This indicates the presence of multiple distinct kinematic components of material at low and high velocities. The low-velocity components are likely to be produced by a dense, slow-moving emitting region near the center, while the broad components are emitted over a larger volume. These observations suggest an asymmetric explosion, supporting the idea of two-component ejecta that influence the resulting late-time spectra and light curves. SN 2016gkg thus presents striking evidence for significant asymmetry in a standard-energy SN explosion. The presence of material at low velocity, which is not predicted in 1D simulations, emphasizes the importance of multi-dimensional explosion modeling of SNe.

title: Curvature-slope correlation of nuclear symmetry energy and its imprints on the crust-core transition, radius and tidal deformability of canonical neutron stars
authors: Bao-An Li, Macon Magno
topic: Background: Nuclear symmetry energy Esym(ρ) encoding information about the energy necessary to make nuclear systems more neutron-rich is poorly known especially at supra-saturation densities but has broad impacts on properties of neutron stars. While its slope parameter L at the saturation density ρ0 of nuclear matter has been relatively well constrained by recent astrophysical observations and terrestrial nuclear experiments, its curvature Ksym characterizing the Esym(ρ) around 2ρ0 remains largely unconstrained. Over 520 calculations for Esym(ρ) using various nuclear theories and interactions in the literature have predicted several significantly different Ksym−L correlations. Purpose: If a unique Ksym−L correlation of Esym(ρ) can be firmly established, it will enable us to progressively better constrain the high-density behavior of Esym(ρ) using the available constraints on its slope parameter L. We investigate if and by how much the different Ksym−L correlations may affect neutron star observables. Method: A meta-model of nuclear Equation of States (EOSs) with three representative Ksym−L correlation functions is used to generate multiple EOSs for neutron stars.

title: Finding quark content of neutron stars in light of GW170817
authors: Rana Nandi, Subrata Pal
topic: The detection of gravitational waves from GW170817 has provided a new opportunity to constrain the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. In this article, we investigate the possible existence of quarks inside the neutron star core in the context of GW170817. The nucleon phase is treated within the relativistic nuclear mean-field approach where we have employed a fully comprehensive set of available models, and the quark phase is described in the Bag model. We show that the nucleonic EOSs which are inconsistent with the tidal deformability bound become consistent when phase transition to quark matter via Gibbs construction is allowed. We find that several nucleonic EOSs support the presence of pure quark matter core with a small mass not more than 0.17Msun confined within a radius of 0.9 km. We also find that the strong correlation between tidal deformability and neutron star radii observed for pure nucleonic stars does persist even with a nucleon-quark phase transition and provides an upper limit on the radius of R1.4 less or eq 12.9 km for a 1.4Msun neutron star.

title: Polarization of GRB Prompt Emission and its Application to POLAR's Data
authors: Mi-Xiang Lan, Xue-Feng Wu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: Synchrotron emission polarization is very sensitive to the magnetic field configuration. Recently, polarization of synchrotron emission with a mixed (SM) magnetic field in Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow phase had been developed. Here, we apply these SM models to GRB prompt phase and compare their polarization properties with that of synchrotron emission in purely ordered (SO) magnetic field. We find that the polarization properties in a SM model are very similar to these in a corresponding SO model (e.g., synchrotron emission in a mixed magnetic field with an aligned ordered part (SMA) and synchrotron emission with a purely ordered aligned magnetic field (SOA)), only with a lower polarization degree (PD). We also discuss the statistical properties of the models. We find PDs of the simulated bursts are concentrated around 25percent for both SOA and synchrotron emission in a purely ordered toroidal magnetic field (SOT), while they can range from 0percent to 25percent for SMA and synchrotron emission in a mixed magnetic field with a toroidal ordered part (SMT), depending on Xi_B value, i.e., the ratio of magnetic reduction of the ordered magnetic field over that of random magnetic field. From statistics, if PDs of majority GRBs are non-zero, then it favours SO and SM models.

title: GRB Spectrum from Gradual Dissipation in a Magnetized Outflow
authors: Ramandeep Gill, Jonathan Granot, Paz Beniamini
topic: Modeling of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission spectra sometimes requires a (quasi-) thermal spectral component in addition to the Band function. In photospheric emission models, a prominent thermal component broadened by sub-photospheric dissipation is expected to be released at the photospheric radius, rph∼10^12cm. We consider an ultra-relativistic strongly magnetized outflow with a striped-wind magnetic-field structure undergoing gradual and continuous magnetic energy dissipation at R less Rs that heats and accelerates the flow, leading to a bulk Lorentz factor where typically Rph less Rs. Similar dynamics and energy dissipation rates are also expected in highly-variable magnetized outflows without stripes/field-reversals. Two modes of particle energy injection are considered: (a) power-law electrons, e.g. accelerated by magnetic reconnection, and (b) continuous distributed heating of all electrons (and e±-pairs), e.g. due to MHD instabilities. Time-resolved energy spectra are obtained using a numerical code that evolves coupled kinetic equations for a photon-electron-positron plasma. We find that (i) the thermal component peaks at.

authors: O. Teboul, N. Shaviv
topic: Linear polarization has been measured in several GRB afterglows. After a few days, polarization arises from the forward shock emission which depends on the post-shock magnetic field. The latter can originate both from compression of existing fields, here the ISM magnetic field, and from shock generated instabilities. For short GRBs, previous modelling of the polarization arising from the forward shock considered a random field fully or partially confined to the shock plane. However, the ISM magnetic field likely consists of both random and ordered components. Here we study the impact of a more realistic magnetic field having both ordered and random components. We present our semi-analytical model and compute polarization curves arising for different magnetic field configurations. We find that the presence of an ordered component, even significantly weaker than the random one, has distinct signatures that could be detectable. In the presence of an ordered component not in the observer plane, we show that: i) for an observer inside the jet, the polarization angle, either remains constant during all the afterglow phase or exhibits variations smaller than the 90degrees swing expected from a random component solely, ii) for an observer outside the jet, the polarization angle evolves from.

title: Hydrodynamical modeling of the light curves of core collapse supernovae with HYPERION. I. The mass range 13-25 Msun, the metallicities -3<=[Fe/H]<=0 and the case of SN1999em
authors: Marco Limongi, Alessandro Chieffi
topic: We present the last version of {\scshape{Hyperion}} (HYdrodynamic Ppm Explosion with Radiation diffusION), a hydrodynamic code designed to calculate the explosive nucleosynthesis, remnant mass and light curve associated to the explosion of a massive star. By means of this code we compute the explosion of a subset of red supergiant models, taken from the database published by \cite{lc18}, for various explosion energies in the range ~0.20−2.00 1051 erg. The main outcomes of these simulations, i.e., remnant mass, 56Ni synthesized, luminosity and length of the plateau of the bolometric light curve, are analyzed as a function of the initial parameters of the star (mass and metallicity) and of the explosion energy. As a first application of {\scshape{Hyperion}} we estimated the mass and the metallicity of the progenitor star of SN 1999em, a well studied SN IIP, by means of the light curve fitting.

title: The Synchrotron Polarization in Decaying Magnetic Field in Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: K.F. Cheng, X.H. Zhao, J.M. Bai
topic: Polarization can serve as a probe of the radiation mechanism and magnetic field (MF) configuration in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In the case of constant MF, the synchrotron polarization in the prompt phase of GRBs has been widely studied. In this paper, we consider the case of the decaying MF. We calculate the time-averaged and instantaneous synchrotron polarizations in a pulse for different viewing angles and for the large-scale decaying MF model, which can explain the so-called Band spectrum. We find that the on-axis time-averaged polarization degree (PD) in the energy band of 50-500 keV for the decaying large-scale MF model (~0.6 for typical parameters) is higher than that in the constant MF model (~0.5). An interesting result is the instantaneous PD in the off-axis case will experience a turnover, i.e., the PD will evolve from a positive value to a negative one. This suggests the polarization angle (PA) change by an angle of 90[deg]. Such a result is roughly consistent with the discovery of the PA evolution within a pulse in some bursts, such as GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A. Our result implies at least a part of bursts (off-axis bursts) should have the PA evolution in a pulse.

title: The Broad-band Counterpart of the Short GRB 200522A at z=0.5536: A Luminous Kilonova or a Collimated Outflow with a Reverse Shock?
authors: W. Fong (Northwestern/CIERA), T. Laskar, J. Rastinejad, A. Rouco Escorial, G. Schroeder, J. Barnes, C. D. Kilpatrick, K. Paterson, E. Berger, B. D. Metzger, et al
topic: We present the discovery of the radio afterglow and near-infrared (NIR) counterpart of the Swift short GRB 200522A, located at a small projected offset of ≈1 kpc from the center of a young, star-forming host galaxy at z=0.5536. The radio and X-ray luminosities of the afterglow are consistent with those of on-axis cosmological short GRBs. The NIR counterpart, revealed by our HST observations at a rest-frame time of approx 2.3 days, has a luminosity of sim (1.3−1.7) times 10 to the power of 42 erg s−1. This is substantially lower than on-axis short GRB afterglow detections, but is a factor of ≈8-17 more luminous than the kilonova of GW170817, and significantly more luminous than any kilonova candidate for which comparable observations exist. The combination of the counterpart's color (i−y=-0.08 pm 0.21; rest-frame) and luminosity cannot be explained by standard radioactive heating alone. We present two scenarios to interpret the broad-band behavior of GRB 200522A: a synchrotron forward shock with a luminous kilonova (potentially boosted by magnetar energy deposition), or forward and reverse shocks from alpha approx 14deg, relativistic (Gamma0 greater 80) jet. Models which include a combination of enhanced radioactive heating rates, low-lanthanide mass fractions, or additional sources of heating from late-time central engine activity may provide viable alternate explanations.

title: Monte-Carlo neutrino transport in neutron star merger simulations
authors: Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, Francois Hebert, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: Gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals from merging neutron star binaries provide valuable information about the the properties of dense matter, the formation of heavy elements, and high-energy astrophysics. To fully leverage observations of these systems, we need numerical simulations that provide reliable predictions for the properties of the matter unbound in these mergers. An important limitation of current simulations is the use of approximate methods for neutrino transport that do not converge to a solution of the transport equations as numerical resolution increases, and thus have errors that are impossible to quantify. Here, we report on a first simulation of a binary neutron star merger that directly solves the transport equations using Monte-Carlo techniques. We demonstrate that a computationally cheap Monte-Carlo transport can be implemented without ill effects from sampling noise. We apply Monte-Carlo transport to an unequal mass neutron star binary merger up to 5ms past merger, and report on the properties of the matter and neutrino outflows. Finally, we compare our results to the output of our best approximate `M1' transport scheme, demonstrating that an M1 scheme that carefully approximates the neutrino energy spectrum only leads to ~10\% uncertainty in the composition and velocity of the ejecta

title: Returning radiation in strong gravity around black holes: Reverberation from the accretion disc
authors: D.R. Wilkins, J.A. García, T. Dauser, A.C. Fabian
topic: We study reflected X-ray emission that returns to the accretion disc in the strong gravitational fields around black holes using General Relativistic ray tracing and radiative transfer calculations. Reflected X-rays that are produced when the inner regions of the disc are illuminated by the corona are subject to strong gravitational light bending, causing up to 47 per cent of the reflected emission to be returned to the disc around a rapidly spinning black hole, depending upon the scale height of the corona. The iron K line is enhanced relative to the continuum by 25 per cent, and the Compton hump by up to a factor of three. Additional light travel time between primary and secondary reflections increases the reverberation time lag measured in the iron K band by 49 per cent, while the soft X-ray lag is increased by 25 per cent and the Compton hump response time is increased by 60 per cent. Measured samples of X-ray reverberation lags are shown to be consistent with X-rays returning to the accretion disc in strong gravity. Understanding the effects of returning radiation is important in interpreting reverberation observations to probe black holes. Reflected X-rays returning to the disc can be uniquely identified by blueshifted returning iron K line photons that are Compton scattered from the inner disc, producing excess, delayed emission in the 3.5-4.5keV energy range that will be detectable with forthcoming X-ray observatories, representing a unique test of General Relativity in the strong field limit.

title: Accretion discs with non-zero central torque
authors: C. J. Nixon, J. E. Pringle
topic: We present analytical and numerical solutions for accretion discs subject to a non-zero central torque. We express this in terms of a single parameter, f, which is the ratio of outward viscous flux of angular momentum from the inner boundary to the inward advected flux of angular momentum there. The standard "accretion" disc, where the central boundary condition is zero-torque, is represented by f=0. A "decretion" disc, where the radial velocity at the inner boundary is zero, is represented by f goes to infinity. For f greater then 0 a torque is applied to the disc at the inner boundary, which feeds both angular momentum and energy into the disc. This can arise, for example, in the case of a circumbinary disc where resonances transfer energy and angular momentum from the binary to the disc orbits, or where the disc is around a rotating magnetic star which can allow the disc orbits to be accelerated outwards at the magnetospheric radius. We present steady-state solutions to the disc structure as a function of f, and for arbitrary kinematic viscosity ν.

title: Identifying black hole central engines in gamma-ray bursts
authors: Vidushi Sharma, Shabnam Iyyani, Dipankar Bhattacharya
topic: The nature of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engine still remains an enigma. Entities widely believed to be capable of powering the extreme jets are magnetars and black holes. The maximum rotational energy that is available in a millisecond magnetar to form a jet is ~10^52 erg. We identify 8 long GRBs whose jet opening angle corrected energetics of the prompt emission episode are >10^52 erg with high confidence level and therefore, their central engines are expected to be black holes. Majority of these GRBs present significant emission in sub-GeV energy range. The X-ray afterglow light curves of these bursts do not show any shallow decay behaviour such as a plateau, however, a few cases exhibit flares and multiple breaks instead of a single power-law decay. For a minimum mass of the black hole (~2 Msun), we find the efficiency of producing a jet from its rotational energy to range between 2\%-270\%. Highly energetic jets requiring high efficiencies implies that either the mass of these black holes are much larger or there are, in addition, other sources of energy which power the jet. By considering the Blandford-Znajek mechanism of jet formation, we estimate the masses of these black holes to range between ~2-60 Msun.

title: Measuring the Hubble Constant with a sample of kilonovae
authors: Michael W. Coughlin, Sarah Antier, Tim Dietrich, Ryan J. Foley, Jack Heinzel, Mattia Bulla, Nelson Christensen, David A. Coulter, Lina Issa, Nandita Khetan
topic: Kilonovae produced by the coalescence of compact binaries with at least one neutron star are promising standard sirens for an independent measurement of the Hubble constant (H0). Through their detection via follow-up of gravitational-wave (GW), short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) or optical surveys, a large sample of kilonovae (even without GW data) can be used for H0 contraints. Here, we show measurement of H0 using light curves associated with four sGRBs, assuming these are attributable to kilonovae, combined with GW170817. Including a systematic uncertainty on the models that is as large as the statistical ones, we find H0=73.8+6.3−5.8\,km s−1 Mpc−1 and H0=71.2+3.2−3.1\,km s−1 Mpc−1 for two different kilonova models that are consistent with the local and inverse-distance ladder measurements. For a given model, this measurement is about a factor of 2-3 more precise than the standard-siren measurement for GW170817 using only GWs.

title: Magnetorotational core collapse of possible GRB progenitors. III. Three-dimensional models
authors: Martin Obergaulinger (1 and 2), Miguel-Ángel Aloy
topic: We explore the influence of non-axisymmetric modes on the dynamics of the collapsed core of rotating, magnetised high-mass stars in three-dimensional simulations of a rapidly rotating star with an initial mass of MZAMS=35Msun endowed with four different pre-collapse configurations of the magnetic field, ranging from moderate to very strong field strength and including the field predicted by the stellar evolution model. The model with the weakest magnetic field achieves shock revival due to neutrino heating in a gain layer characterised by a large-scale, hydrodynamic m=1 spiral mode. Later on, the growing magnetic field of the proto neutron star launches weak outflows into the early ejecta. Their orientation follows the evolution of the rotational axis of the proto neutron star, which starts to tilt from the original orientation due to the asymmetric accretion flows impinging on its surface. The models with stronger magnetisation generate mildly relativistic, magnetically driven polar outflows propagating over a distance of 104 km within a few 100 ms. These jets are stabilised against disruptive non-axisymmetric instabilities by their fast propagation and by the shear of their toroidal magnetic field. Within the simulation times of around 1 s, the explosions reach moderate energies and the growth of the proto neutron star masses ceases at values substantially below the threshold for black hole formation, which, in combination with the high rotational energies, might suggest a possible later proto-magnetar activity.

title: Short gamma-ray bursts and the decompression of neutron star matter in tidal streams
authors: C. J. Nixon, E. R. Coughlin, J. E. Pringle
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) are generally thought to result from the merger of two neutron stars or the merger of a neutron star with a black hole. It is becoming standard practise to model these mergers with hydrodynamical simulations that employ equations of state that are derived, for example, for determining the behaviour of matter in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), and which therefore make use of the assumption that the matter is hot and in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). In this Letter we draw attention to the fact that the hydrodynamical timescale (roughly the gravitational timescale of the neutron star) may be several orders of magnitude shorter than the timescale on which such equilibrium can be re-established in the tidal debris ejected during a sGRB, and that on the initial decompression timescales the unshocked tidal ejecta may remain sufficiently cool that the employed equations of state are not appropriate for modelling the dynamics of this part of the flow. On timescales short compared with the timescale on which NSE can be (re)established, the equation of state can remain relatively stiff and thus the stream of tidal debris can remain narrow and vulnerable to gravitational instability, as has recently been suggested. These findings suggest that estimates of the type and abundances of heavy elements formed in short gamma-ray bursts need to be revisited. We suggest that the most direct method of testing the physical and dynamical properties of tidal ejecta in sGRBs will come from modelling of their light curves, which provides the cleanest source of information on the system dynamics.

title: Delta baryons and diquark formation in the cores of neutron stars
authors: German Malfatti, Milva G. Orsaria, Ignacio F. Ranea-Sandoval, Gustavo A. Contrera, Fridolin Weber
topic: We investigate the hadron-quark phase transition in cold neutron stars in light of (i) the observed limits on the maximum-mass of heavy pulsars, (ii) constraints on the tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted in binary neutron-star mergers, and (iii) mass and radius constraints derived from the observation of hot spots on neutron star observed with NICER. Special attention is directed to the possible presence of Delta(1232) baryons in neutron star matter. Our results indicate that this particle could make up a large fraction of the baryons in neutron stars and thus have a significant effect on the properties of such objects, particularly on their radii. This is partially caused by the low density appearance of Δs for a wide range of theoretically defensible sets of meson-hyperon, SU(3) ESC08 model, and meson-Delta coupling constants. The transition of hadronic matter to quark matter, treated in the 2SC+s condensation phase, is found to occur only in neutron stars very close to the mass peak.

authors: Daniel M. Siegel
topic: The gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo together with their electromagnetic partner facilities have transformed the modus operandi in which we seek information about the Universe. The first ever-observed neutron-star merger---GW170817---confirmed the association of short gamma-ray bursts with neutron-star mergers and the production of heavy (r-process) elements. Based on recent theoretical and observational developments, I briefly present and discuss a conjecture, namely that compact accretion disks in both short and long gamma-ray bursts synthesize most of the heavy r-process elements in the Universe. The upcoming era of multi-messenger astronomy may allow us to verify or falsify this conjecture.

title: Interpreting the X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts
with radiative losses and millisecond magnetars
authors: Nikhil Sarin, Paul D. Lasky, Gregory Ashton
topic: The spin-down energy of millisecond magnetars has been invoked to explain X-ray afterglow observations of a significant fraction of short and long gamma-ray bursts. Here, we extend models previously introduced in the literature, incorporating radiative losses with the spin down of a magnetar central engine through an arbitrary braking index. Combining this with a model for the tail of the prompt emission, we show that our model can better explain the data than millisecond-magnetar models without radiative losses or those that invoke spin down solely through vacuum dipole radiation. We find that our model predicts a subset of X-ray flares seen in some gamma-ray bursts. We can further explain the diversity of X-ray plateaus by altering the radiative efficiency and measure the braking index of newly-born millisecond magnetars. We measure the braking index of GRB061121 as n=4.85+0.11-0.15 suggesting the millisecond-magnetar born in this gamma-ray burst spins down predominantly through gravitational-wave emission.

title: A scalable random forest regressor for combining neutron-star equation of state measurements: A case study with GW170817 and GW190425
authors: Francisco Hernandez Vivanco, Rory Smith, Eric Thrane, Paul D. Lasky
topic: Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star coalescences constrain the neutron-star equation of state by enabling measurement of the tidal deformation of each neutron star. This deformation is determined by the tidal deformability parameter Λ, which was constrained using the first binary neutron star gravitational-wave observation, GW170817. Now, with the measurement of the second binary neutron star, GW190425, we can combine different gravitational-wave measurements to obtain tighter constraints on the neutron-star equation of state. In this paper, we combine data from GW170817 and GW190425 to place constraints on the neutron-star equation of state. To facilitate this calculation, we derive interpolated marginalized likelihoods for each event using a machine learning algorithm. These likelihoods, which we make publicly available, allow for results from multiple gravitational-wave signals to be easily combined.

title: The surface of rapidly-rotating neutron stars: implications to neutron star parameter estimation
authors: Hector O. Silva, George Pappas, Nicolás Yunes, Kent Yagi
topic: The Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) is currently observing the x-ray pulse profiles emitted by hot spots on the surface of rotating neutron stars allowing for an inference of their radii with unprecedented precision. A critical ingredient in the pulse profile model is an analytical formula for the oblate shape of the star. These formulas require a fitting over a large ensemble of neutron star solutions, which cover a wide set of equations of state, stellar compactnesses and rotational frequencies. However, this procedure introduces a source of systematic error, as (i) the fits do not describe perfectly the surface of all stars in the ensemble and (ii) neutron stars are described by a single equation of state, whose influence on the surface shape is averaged out during the fitting procedure. Here we perform a first study of this systematic error, finding evidence that it is subdominant relative to the statistical error in the radius inference by NICER. We also find evidence that the formula currently used by NICER can be used in the inference of the radii of rapidly rotating stars, outside of the formula's domain of validity. Moreover, we employ an accurate enthalpy-based method to locate the surface of numerical solutions of rapidly rotating neutron stars and a new highly-accurate formula to describe their surfaces.

authors: Smaranika Banerjee, Masaomi Tanaka, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Daiji Kato, Gediminas Gaigalas
topic: We present radiative transfer simulations for blue kilonovae hours after neutron star (NS) mergers by performing detailed opacity calculations for the first time. We calculate atomic structures and opacities of highly ionized elements (up to the tenth ionization) with atomic number Z = 20 - 56. We find that the bound-bound transitions of heavy elements are the dominant source of the opacities in the early phase (t less 1 day after the merger), and that the ions with a half-closed electron shell provide the highest contributions. The Planck mean opacity for lanthanide-free ejecta (with electron fraction of Ye = 0.30 - 0.40) can only reach around kappa similar 0.5 - 1 cm^2 g^-1 at t = 0.1 day, whereas that increases up to kappa ~ 5 - 10 cm^2 g^-1 at t = 1 day. The spherical ejecta model with an ejecta mass of Mej = 0.05Msun gives the bolometric luminosity of similar 2 x 10^42 erg s^-1 at t similar to 0.1 day. We confirm that the existing bolometric and multi-color data of GW170817 can be naturally explained by the purely radioactive model.

topic: The multi-messenger discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) and light from the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817, associated with Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 170817A and kilonova AT2017gfo, has marked the start of a new era in astrophysics. GW170817 has confirmed that binary NS mergers are progenitors of at least some short GRBs. The peculiar properties of the GRB 170817A radio afterglow, characterized by a delayed onset related to the off-axis geometry, have also demonstrated how some nearby short GRBs may not be identified as such with standard short-timescale electromagnetic follow-up observations. Building upon this new information, we performed late-time radio observations of a sample of four short GRBs with unknown redshift and no previously detected afterglow in the \textit{Swift}/BAT sample in order to identify nearby (dL less 200 Mpc) off-axis GRB candidates via their potential late-time radio signatures. We find a previously uncatalogued radio source within the error region of GRB 130626 with a 3-6 GHz flux density consistent with a NS radio flare at a distance of approx 100 Mpc. However, an origin related to a persistent radio source unrelated to the GRB cannot be excluded given the high chance of false positives in error regions as large as those considered here. Further radio follow-up observations are needed to better understand the origin of this source.

title: Magnetar giant flare origin for GRB 200415A inferred from a new scaling relation
authors: Hai-Ming Zhang, Ruo-Yu Liu, Shu-Qing Zhong, Xiang-Yu Wang
topic: Soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are mainly a Galactic population and originate from neutron stars with intense (B sim 10 power of 15 G) magnetic fields (magnetars). Occasionally (once every 30−40\,yr), a giant flare occurs with enormous intensity, displaying a short hard spike, followed by a weaker, oscillatory phase which exhibits the period of the neutron star. If the magnetar giant flares occur in nearby galaxies, they would appear as cosmic short-hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) without detecting the weak oscillatory phase. Recently, a short-hard GRB named GRB 200415A was detected, with a position coincident with the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), rasing the question whether it is a classic short GRB or a magentar giant flare. Here we show that magnetar giant flares follow a scaling relation between the spectral peak energy and the isotropic energy in. The relation can be well understood in the model that giant flares arise from the photosphere emissions of relativistically expanding fireball. GRB 200415A, together with two other candidate giant flares (GRB 051103 and GRB 070201) follow this relation, which strongly favor the giant flare origin of these GRBs. The GeV emission detected by \emph{Fermi}/LAT from GRB 200415A at 18−285s can also be explained in the giant flare scenario

title: A comparison of momentum transport models for numerical relativity
authors: Matthew D. Duez, Alexander Knight, Francois Foucart, Milad Haddadi, Jerred Jesse, Francois Hebert, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: The main problems of nonvacuum numerical relativity, compact binary mergers and stellar collapse, involve hydromagnetic instabilities and turbulent flows, so that kinetic energy at small scales have mean effects at large scale that drive the secular evolution. Notable among these effects is momentum transport. We investigate two models of this transport effect, a relativistic Navier-Stokes system and a turbulent mean stress model, that are similar to all of the prescriptions that have been attempted to date for treating subgrid effects on binary neutron star mergers and their aftermath. Our investigation involves both stability analysis and numerical experimentation on star and disk systems. We also begin the investigation of the effects of particle and heat transport on post-merger simulations. We find that correct handling of turbulent heating can be important for avoiding unphysical instabilities. Given such appropriate handling, the evolution of a differentially rotating star and the accretion rate of a disk are reassuringly insensitive to the choice of prescription. However, disk outflows can be sensitive to the choice of method, even for the same effective viscous strength. We also consider the effects of eddy diffusion in the evolution of an accretion disk and show that it can interestingly affect the composition of outflows.

topic: Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of Low Mass X-ray Binaries in the hard state are determined by the emission from a jet, for frequencies up to mid-infrared, and emission from the accretion flow in the optical to X-ray range. In the last years, the flat radio-to-mid-IR spectra of Black Hole (BH) X-ray binaries was described using the internal shocks model, which assumes that the fluctuations in the velocity of the ejecta along the jet are driven by the fluctuations in the accretion flow, described by the X-ray Power Density Spectrum (PDS). In this work we attempt to apply this model for the first time to a Neutron Star (NS) LMXB, i.e. 4U 0614+091. We used the multi-wavelength data set obtained in 2006, comprising data from radio to X-ray, and applied a model which includes an irradiated disc model for the accretion flow and an updated version of the internal shocks code for the ejection. The new version of the code allows to change the geometry of the jet for the case of non-conical jets.

title: Analytic properties of electromagnetic field of binary compact stars and electromagnetic precursors to gravitational waves
authors: Tomoki Wada, Masaru Shibata, Kunihito Ioka
topic: We analytically study the properties of the electromagnetic field in vacuum around close binary compact stars containing at least one neutron star. We show that the orbital motion of the neutron star induces high multipole modes of the electromagnetic field just before the merger. These modes are superimposed to form a spiral arm configuration and its edge is found to be a likely site for magnetic reconnection. These modes also enhance the total Poynting flux from neutron star binaries by a factor of 2--4. We also indicate that the electric field induced by the orbital motion lead to a magnetosphere around binaries and estimate its plasma density, which has a different parameter dependence than Goldreich-Julian density. With these properties, we discuss possible electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events, and identify radio precursors, such as fast radio bursts, as the most promising observational targets.

title: Self-similar Evolutionary Solutions for Accreting Magneto-fluid around a Compact Object with Finite Electrical Conductivity
authors: F. Habibi, R. Pazhouhesh, M. Shaghaghian
topic: In this paper, we investigate the time evolution an accreting magneto-fluid with finite conductivity. For the case of a thin disk, the fluid equations along with Maxwell equations are derived in a simplified, one-dimensional model that neglects the latitudinal dependence of the flow. The finite electrical conductivity is taken into account for the plasma through Ohm law; however, the shear viscous stress is neglected, as well as the self-gravity of the disk. In order to solve the integrated equations that govern the dynamical behaviour of the magneto-fluid, we have used a self-similar solution. We introduce two dimensionless variables, S0 and epssilon_ρ, which show the magnitude of electrical conductivity and the density behaviour with time, respectively. The effect of each of these on the structure of the disk is studied. While the pressure is obtained simply by solving an ordinary differential equation, the density, the magnetic field, the radial velocity and the rotational velocity are presented analytically.

The cases differ only in numerics, modelling the same physical scenario of a radiatively inefficient, geometrically thick, magnetically arrested flow onto a rapidly spinning black hole. Properties inferred with the coarsest grid generally agree with those found with higher resolutions, including total jet power and its decomposition into different forms, velocity structure, nonaxisymmetric structure, and the appearance of resolved millimetre images. Some measures of variability and magnetization are sensitive to resolution. We conclude that most results obtained by limiting resolution near the jet for computational expediency should still be reliable, at least insofar as they would not be improved with a finer grid.

title: The possibility of the secondary object in GW190814 as a neutron star
authors: Kaixuan Huang, Jinniu Hu, Ying Zhang, Hong Shen
topic: A compact object was observed with a mass 2.50−2.67 Msun by LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations (LVC) in GW190814, which provides a great challenge to the investigations into the supranuclear matter. To study this object, properties of neutron star are systematically calculated within the latest density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) parameterizations, which are determined by the ground state properties of spherical nuclei. The maximum masses of neutron star calculated by DD-MEX and DD-LZ1 sets can be around 2.55 Msun with quite stiff equations of state generated by their strong repulsive contributions from vector potentials at high densities.

topic: Binary neutron stars (BNSs) will spend ≃10 -- 15 minutes in the band of Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors at design sensitivity. Matched-filtering of gravitational-wave (GW) data could in principle accumulate enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to identify a forthcoming event tens of seconds before the companions collide and merge. Here we report on the design and testing of an early warning gravitational-wave detection pipeline.

title: On The Development of Multidimensional Progenitor Models For Core-collapse Supernovae
authors: C. E. Fields, S. M. Couch
topic: Multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations of shell convection in massive stars suggest the development of aspherical perturbations that may be amplified during iron core-collapse. These perturbations have a crucial and qualitative impact on the delayed neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism by increasing the total stress behind the stalled shock. In this paper, we investigate the properties of a 15 \msun model evolved in 1-,2-, and 3-dimensions (3D) for the final ∼424 seconds before gravitational instability and iron core-collapse using MESA and the FLASH simulation framework. We find that just before collapse, our initially perturbed fully 3D model reaches angle-averaged convective velocity magnitudes...

title: Time dependence of advection dominated accretion flow around a rotating compact object
authors: Fahimeh Habibi
topic: Time evolution of advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) around a rotating compact object is presented. The equations of time-dependent of fluid including the Coriolis force along with the centrifugal and pressure gradient forces are derived. In this research, it is assumed that angular momentum transport is due to viscous turbulence and the {\alpha}-prescription is used for the kinematic coefficient of viscosity. Moreover, the general relativistic effects are neglected. In order to solve the equations, we have used a self-similar solution. The solutions show that the behaviour of the physical quantities in a dynamical ADAF is different from that for a steady accretion flow. Our results indicate that the physical quantities are dependent of rotation parameter which is defined as the ratio of the intrinsic angular velocity of the central body to the angular velocity of disc. Also, the effect of rotation parameter on these quantities is different for co and counter-rotating flows.

title: Modeling the Galactic Compact Binary Neutron Star Population and Studying the Double Pulsar System
authors: Nihan Pol
topic: In this dissertation, we estimate the population of different classes of BNS systems that are visible to gravitational-wave observatories. Given that no ultra-compact BNS systems have been discovered in pulsar radio surveys, we place a 95 percent confidence upper limit of ~850 and ~1100 ultra-compact neutron star--white dwarf and double neutron star (DNS) systems respectively. We show that among all of the current radio pulsar surveys, the ones at the Arecibo radio telescope have the best chance of detecting an ultra-compact BNS system. We also show that adopting a survey integration time of tint~1~min will maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, and thus, the probability of detecting an ultra-compact BNS system.

title: Magnetorotational core collapse of possible GRB progenitors. II. Formation of protomagnetars and collapsars
authors: Miguel-Ángel Aloy (1), Martin Obergaulinger 
topic: We assess the variance of the post-collapse evolution remnants of compact, massive, low-metallicity stars, under small changes in the degrees of rotation and magnetic field of selected pre-supernova cores. These stellar models are commonly considered progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts. The fate of the proto-neutron star (PNS) formed after collapse, whose mass may continuously grow due to accretion, critically depends on the poloidal magnetic field strength at bounce. Should the poloidal magnetic field be sufficiently weak, the PNS collapses to a black hole (BH) within a few seconds. Models on this evolutionary track contain promising collapsar engines. Poloidal magnetic fields smooth over large radial scales (e.g. dipolar fields) or slightly augmented with respect to the original pre-supernova core yield long-lasting PNSs. In these models, BH formation is avoided or staved off for a long time, hence, they may produce proto-magnetars (PMs). Some of our PM candidates have been run for ≲10s after core bounce, but they have not entered the Kelvin-Helmholtz phase yet.

title: Searching for the radio remnants of short duration gamma-ray bursts
authors: Roberto Ricci, Eleonora Troja, Gabriele Bruni, Tatsuya Matsumoto,
topic: Neutron star mergers produce a substantial amount of fast-moving ejecta, expanding outwardly for years after the merger. The interaction of these ejecta with the surrounding medium may produce a weak isotropic radio remnant, detectable in relatively nearby events. We use late-time radio observations of short duration gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) to constrain this model. Two samples of events were studied: four sGRBs that are possibly in the local (less 200 Mpc) universe were selected to constrain the remnant non-thermal emission from the sub-relativistic ejecta, whereas 17 sGRBs at cosmological distances were used to constrain the presence of a proto-magnetar central engine, possibly re-energezing the merger ejecta. We consider the case of GRB~170817A/GW170817, and find that in this case the early radio emission may be quenched by the jet blast-wave.

authors: Shotaro Yamasaki (HUJI), Kazumi Kashiyama (U. Tokyo), Kohta Murase (PSU)
topic: Recently, a bright coherent radio burst with millisecond duration, reminiscent of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs), was co-detected with an anomalously-hard X-ray burst from a Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. We investigate the possibility that the event was triggered by a deposition of a magnetic energy in a localized region of the magnetosphere, thereby producing a so-called trapped fireball (FB) and simultaneously launching relativistic outflows. We show that the thermal component of the X-ray burst spectrum is consistent with a trapped FB with an average temperature of a few hundred keV and a size of. Meanwhile, the non-thermal component of the X-ray burst and the coherent radio burst may arise from relativistic outflows. We calculate the dynamical evolution of the outflow, launched with an energy budget  comparable to that of the trapped FB.

title: MeV Gamma Rays from Fission: A Distinct Signature of Actinide Production in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Xilu Wang, Nicole Vassh, Trevor Sprouse, Matthew Mumpower, Ramona Vogt, Jorgen Randrup, Rebecca Surman
topic: Neutron star mergers (NSMs) are the first verified site of rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, and could emit gamma rays from the radioactive isotopes synthesized in the neutron-rich ejecta. These MeV gamma rays may provide a unique and direct probe of the NSM environment as well insight into the nature of the r process, just as observed gammas from the 56Ni radioactive decay chain provide a window into supernova nucleosynthesis. In this work, we include the photons from fission processes for the first time in estimates of the MeV gamma-ray signal expected from a NSM event. We consider NSM ejecta compositions with a range of neutron richness and find a dramatic difference in the predicted signal depending on whether or not fissioning nuclei are produced.

title: New quasi-universal relations for static and rapid rotating neutron stars
authors: Wenjie Sun, Dehua Wen, Jue Wang
topic: In the last few decades, lots of universal relations between different global physical quantities of neutron stars have been proposed to constrain the unobservable or hard to be observed properties of neutron stars. But few of them are related to the gravitational redshift or the gravitational binding energy, especially for the fast rotating neutron stars. Here we will focus on the universal relations related to these two quantities. Based on 11 equations of state (EOSs) from the predictions of microscopic nuclear many-body theories for normal or hybrid neutron stars, we proposed a set of new quasi-universal relations under three rotating cases: static, general rotating and Keplerian rotating. These new quasi-universal relations provide a potential way to constrain or estimate the unobservable or hard to be observed properties of neutron stars.

To obtain a proper distribution of the parameters of the EOS that is consistent with the observation, Bayesian analysis is used and the constraints of causality and maximum mass are considered. From this analysis, it is found that the symmetry energy at twice the saturation density of nuclear matter can be constrained within ...

title: Magnetic Energy Release, Plasma Dynamics and Particle Acceleration during Relativistic Turbulent Magnetic Reconnection
authors: Fan Guo, Xiaocan Li, William Daughton, Hui Li, Patrick Kilian, Yi-Hsin Liu, Qile Zhang, Haocheng Zhang
topic: In strongly magnetized astrophysical plasma systems, magnetic reconnection is believed to be the primary process during which explosive energy release and particle acceleration occur, leading to significant high-energy emission. Past years have seen active development of kinetic modeling of relativistic magnetic reconnection, supporting this magnetically dominated scenario. A much less explored issue in studies of relativistic reconnection is the consequence of three-dimensional dynamics, where turbulent structures are naturally generated as various types of instabilities develop. This paper presents a series of large-scale, three-dimensional, fully-kinetic simulations of relativistic turbulent magnetic reconnection (RTMR) in positron-electron plasmas. Our simulations start from a force-free current sheet with several different modes of long wavelength magnetic field perturbations, which drive additional turbulence in the reconnection region. Because of this, the current layer breaks up and the reconnection region quickly evolves into a turbulent layer filled with coherent structures such as flux ropes and current sheets. We find that plasma dynamics in RTMR is vastly different from their 2D counterparts in many aspects.

title: Formation of disks with long-lived spiral arms from violent gravitational dynamics
authors: Francesco Sylos Labini, Luis Diego Pinto, Roberto Capuzzo-Dolcetta
topic: By means of simple dynamical experiments we study the combined effect of gravitational and gas dynamics in the evolution of an initially out-of-equilibrium, uniform and rotating massive over-density thought as in isolation. The rapid variation of the system mean field potential makes the point-like particles (PP), that interact only via Newtonian gravity, to form a quasi-stationary thick disk dominated by rotational motions surrounded by far out-of-equilibrium spiral arms. On the other side, the gas component is subjected to compression shocks and radiative cooling so to develop a much flatter disk, where rotational motions are coherent and the velocity dispersion is smaller than that of PP. Around such gaseous disk long-lived, but non-stationary, spiral arms form: these are made of gaseous particles that move coherently because have acquired a specific phase-space correlation during the gravitational collapse phase. Such a phase-space correlation represents a signature of the violent origin of the arms and implies both the motion of matter and the transfer of energy.

title: GRB 140423A: A Case of Stellar Wind to Interstellar Medium Transition in the Afterglow
authors: Long Li, Xiang-Gao Wang, WeiKang Zheng, Alexei S. Pozanenko, Alexei V. Filippenko, et al
topic: We present very early ground-based optical follow-up observations of GRB~140423A, which was discovered by \emph{Swift}/BAT and by {\it Fermi}/GBM. Its broadband afterglow was monitored by {\it Swift}/XRT and ground-based optical telescopes from T0+70.96~s to 4.8~d after the {\it Swift}/BAT trigger. This is one more case of prompt optical emission observation. The temporal and spectral joint fit of the multiwavelength light curves of GRB 140423A reveals that achromatic behavior is consistent with the external shock model including a transition from a stellar wind to the interstellar medium (ISM) and energy injection. In terms of the optical light curves, there is an onset bump in the early afterglow , with a steeper to flatter "transition" . he observed X-ray afterglow reflects an achromatic behavior, as does the optical light curve. There is no obvious evolution of the spectral energy distribution between the X-ray and optical afterglow, with an average value of the photon index, Gamma = 2. This "transition" is consistent with an external shock model having the circumburst medium transition from a wind to the ISM, by introducing a long-lasting energy injection with a Lorentz factor stratification of the ejecta.

title: The infancy of core-collapse supernova remnants
authors: Michael Gabler, Annop Wongwathanarat, Hans-Thomas Janka
topic: We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-driven supernovae (SNe) with the Prometheus-HotB code, evolving the asymmetrically expanding ejecta from shock breakout until they reach the homologous expansion phase after roughly one year. Our calculations continue the simulations for two red supergiant (RSG) and two blue supergiant (BSG) progenitors by Wongwathanarat et al., who investigated the growth of explosion asymmetries produced by hydrodynamic instabilities during the first second of the explosion and their later fragmentation by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. We focus on the late time acceleration and inflation of the ejecta caused by the heating due to the radioactive decay of 56Ni to 56Fe and by a new outward-moving shock, which forms when the reverse shock from the He/H-shell interface compresses the central part of the ejecta. The mean velocities of the iron-rich ejecta increase between 100 km/s and 350 km/s (sim 8-30\%), and the fastest one percent of the iron accelerates by up to sim 1000 km/s (sim 20-25percent). This `Ni-bubble effect', known from 1D models, accelerates the bulk of the nickel in our 3D models and causes an inflation of the initially overdense Ni-rich clumps, which leads to underdense, extended fingers, enveloped by overdense skins of compressed surrounding matter.

title: Magnetohydrodynamic waves excited by a coupling between gravitational waves and a strongly magnetized plasma in binaries of neutron stars
authors: Adam S. Gontijo, Oswaldo D. Miranda
topic: Coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNSs) is one of the sources of gravitational waves (GWs) able to be detected by ground-based interferometric detectors. The event GW170817 was the first observed in the gravitational and electromagnetic spectra, showing through this joint analysis a certain compatibility with the models of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) to explain the signature of this system. Due to the intense magnetic fields of the neutron stars, the plasma magnetosphere stays strongly magnetized and the propagation of the GW through plasma can excite magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes such as Alfvén and magnetosonic waves. The MHD modes carry energy and momentum through the plasma, suggesting a mechanism to accelerate the matter during the coalescence of the binaries, explaining some characteristics of the fireball model of the sGRBs. We present a semianalytical formalism to determine the energy transferred by the GW-MHD interaction during the inspiral phase of the stars

authors: Aaron Smith, Rahul Kannan, Benny T.-H. Tsang, Mark Vogelsberger, Ruediger Pakmor
topic: We present Arepo-MCRT, a novel Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) solver for the unstructured moving-mesh code Arepo. Our method is designed for general multiple scattering problems in both optically-thin and -thick conditions. We incorporate numerous efficiency improvements and noise reduction schemes to help overcome efficiency barriers that typically inhibit convergence. These include continuous absorption and energy deposition, photon weighting and luminosity boosting, local packet merging and splitting, path-based statistical estimators, conservative (face-centered) momentum coupling, adaptive convergence between time-steps, Implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) for thermal emission, and discrete diffusion Monte Carlo (DDMC) for unresolved scattering, including a novel advection scheme. We primarily focus on the unique aspects of our implementation and discussions of the advantages and drawbacks of our methods in various astrophysical contexts. Finally, we consider several test applications including the levitation of an optically thick layer of gas by trapped IR radiation. We find the initial acceleration phase and revitalized second wind are connected via self-regulation of the RHD coupling, such that the RHD method accuracy and simulation resolution each leave important imprints on the long-term behavior of the gas.

title: The permanent ellipticity of the neutron star in PSR J1023+0038
authors: Sudip Bhattacharyya
topic: A millisecond pulsar having an ellipticity, that is an asymmetric mass distribution around its spin-axis, could emit continuous gravitational waves, which have not been detected so far. An indirect way to infer such waves is to estimate the contribution of the waves to the spin-down rate of the pulsar. The transitional pulsar PSR J1023+0038 is ideal and unique for this purpose, because this is the only millisecond pulsar for which the spin-down rate has been measured in both accreting and non-accreting states. Here we infer, from our formalism based on the complete torque budget equations and the pulsar magnetospheric origin of observed γ-rays in the two states, that PSR J1023+0038 should emit gravitational waves due to a permanent ellipticity of the pulsar.

title: Hint of a tension between Nuclear physics and Astrophysical observations
authors: Bhaskar Biswas, Prasanta Char, Rana Nandi, Sukanta Bose
topic: Observations of neutron stars by the LIGO-Virgo and NICER collaborations have provided us reasonably precise measurements of their various macroscopic properties. In this letter, within a fully Bayesian framework, we combine them to put joint constraints on the properties of neutron stars based on an empirical parameterization of nuclear matter. These values imply a somewhat stiffer equation of state for neutron stars in comparison to those found in other studies that were based on spectral or piecewise polytropic parameterization, which are agnostic to nuclear physics constraints. This indicates a tension between nuclear physics inputs and astrophysical observations. Specifically, we show that this empirically parameterized nuclear equation of state disfavors the softness found in astrophysical observations at a statistically significant level.

title: Radiative Emission Mechanisms of Tidal Disruption Events
authors: Nathaniel Roth, Elena M. Rossi, Julian H. Krolik, Tsvi Piran, Brenna Mockler, Daniel Kasen
topic: We describe how the various outcomes of stellar tidal disruption give rise to observable radiation. We separately consider the cases where gas circularizes rapidly into an accretion disc, as well as the case when shocked debris streams provide the observable emission without having fully circularized. For the rapid circularization case, we describe how outflows, absorption by reprocessing layers, and Comptonization can cause the observed radiation to depart from that of a bare disc, possibly giving rise to the observed optical/UV emission along with soft X-rays from the disc. If, instead, most of the debris follows highly eccentric orbits for a significant time, many properties of the observed optical/UV emission can be explained by the scale of those eccentric orbits and the shocks embedded in the debris flow near orbital apocenter. In this picture, soft X-ray emission at early times results from the smaller amount of debris mass deflected into a compact accretion disc by weak shocks near the stellar pericenter. A general proposal for the near-constancy of the ultraviolet/optical color temperatures is provided, by linking it to incomplete thermalization of radiation in the atmosphere of the emitting region. We also briefly discuss the radio signals from the interaction of unbound debris and jets with the black hole environment.

title: Fast Radio Burst Breakouts from Magnetar Burst Fireballs
authors: Kunihito Ioka
topic: The recent discovery of a Mega-Jansky radio burst simultaneously with short X-ray bursts from the Galactic magnetar (strongly-magnetized neutron star (NS)) SGR 1935+2154 is a smoking gun for the hypothesis that some cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs) arise from magnetar bursts. We argue that the X-ray bursts with high temperature T∼80 keV entail an electron-positron (e plus minus) outflow from a trapped-expanding fireball, polluting the NS magnetosphere before the FRB emission. The e-(plus minus) outflow is opaque to induced Compton scatterings of FRB photons, and is strongly Compton-dragged by the X-ray bursts. Nevertheless the FRB photons can break out the e± outflow with radiation forces if the FRB emission radius is larger than a few tens of NS radii. A FRB is chocked if the FRB is weaker or X-ray bursts are stronger, possibly explaining no FRBs with giant flares and no detectable X-ray bursts with weak FRBs. We also speculate that the e (plus minus) outflow may be needed to generate FRBs, solving why the FRBs occur only with the high-T X-ray bursts. The breakout physics is important for constraining the emission mechanism and electromagnetic counterparts to future FRBs.

title: Additivity of relative magnetic helicity in finite volumes
authors: Gherardo Valori, Pascal Démoulin, Etienne Pariat, Anthony Yeates, Kostas Moraitis, Luis Linan
topic: Relative magnetic helicity is conserved by magneto-hydrodynamic evolution even in the presence of moderate resistivity. For that reason, it is often invoked as the most relevant constraint to the dynamical evolution of plasmas in complex systems, such as solar and stellar dynamos, photospheric flux emergence, solar eruptions, and relaxation processes in laboratory plasmas. However, such studies often indirectly imply that relative magnetic helicity in a given spatial domain can be algebraically split into the helicity contributions of the composing subvolumes, i.e., that it is an additive quantity. A limited number of very specific applications have shown that this is not the case. Progress in understanding the non-additivity of relative magnetic helicity requires removal of restrictive assumptions in favour of a general formalism that can be used both in theoretical investigations as well as in numerical applications. We derive the analytical gauge-invariant expression for the partition of relative magnetic helicity between contiguous finite-volumes, without any assumptions on either the shape of the volumes and interface, or the employed gauge.

authors: Giancarlo Mattia, Christian Fendt
topic: Astrophysical jets are launched from strongly magnetized systems that host an accretion disk surrounding a central object. Here we address the question how to generate the accretion disk magnetization and field structure required for jet launching. We continue our work from Paper I (Mattia & Fendt 2020a), considering a non-scalar accretion disk mean-field alpha2Omega-dynamo in the context of large scale disk-jet simulations. We now investigate a disk dynamo that follows analytical solutions of mean-field dynamo theory, essentially based only on a single parameter, the Coriolis number. We thereby confirm the anisotropy of the dynamo tensor acting in accretion disks, allowing to relate both the resistivity and mean-field dynamo to the disk turbulence. Our new model recovers previous simulations applying a purely radial initial field, while allowing for a more stable evolution for seed fields with a vertical component. We also present correlations between the strength of the disk dynamo coefficients and the dynamical parameters of the jet that is launched, and discuss their implication for observed jet quantities.

authors: Igor Andreoni, Erik C. Kool, Ana Sagues Carracedo, Mansi M. Kasliwal, Mattia Bulla, Tomas Ahumada, et al
topic: To date, no compelling kilonova has been found during optical surveys of the sky, independent of gravitational-wave triggers. In this work, we searched the first 23 months of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream for candidate kilonovae in the form of rapidly evolving transients. We combined ZTF alert queries with forced point-spread-function photometry and nightly flux stacking to increase our sensitivity to faint and fast transients. Automatic queries yielded >11,200 candidates, 24 of which passed quality checks and strict selection criteria based on a grid of kilonova models tailored for both binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers. None of the candidates in our sample was deemed a possible kilonova after thorough vetting, catalog cross-matching, and study of their color evolution. The sources that passed our selection criteria are dominated by Galactic cataclysmic variables. In addition, we identified two fast transients at high Galactic latitude, one of which is the confirmed afterglow of long-duration GRB190106A, and the other is a possible cosmological afterglow. Using a survey simulation code, we constrained the kilonova rate for a range of models including top-hat and linearly decaying light curves and synthetic light curves obtained with radiative transfer simulations.

title: High-Energy Neutrinos and Gamma-Rays from Non-Relativistic Shock-Powered Transients
authors: Ke Fang, Brian D. Metzger, Indrek Vurm, Elias Aydi, Laura Chomiuk
topic: Shock interaction has been argued to play a role in powering a range of optical transients, including supernovae (particularly the superluminous class), classical novae, stellar mergers, tidal disruption events, and fast blue optical transients. These same shocks can accelerate relativistic ions, generating high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission via hadronic pion production. The recent discovery of time-correlated optical and gamma-ray emission in classical novae has revealed the important role of radiative shocks in powering these events, enabling an unprecedented view of the properties of ion acceleration, including its efficiency and energy spectrum, under similar physical conditions to shocks in extragalactic transients. Here we introduce a model for connecting the radiated optical fluence of non-relativistic transients to their maximal neutrino and gamma-ray fluence. We apply this technique to a wide range of extragalactic transient classes in order to place limits on their contributions to the cosmological high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds.

title: MHD accretion-ejection: jets launched by a non-isotropic accretion disk dynamo. I. Validation and application of selected dynamo tensorial components
authors: Giancarlo Mattia, Christian Fendt
topic: Astrophysical jets are launched from strongly magnetized systems that host an accretion disk surrounding a central object. The origin of the jet launching magnetic field is one of the open questions for modeling the accretion-ejection process. Here we address the question how to generate the accretion disk magnetization and field structure required for jet launching. Applying the PLUTO code, we present the first resistive MHD simulations of jet launching including a non-scalar accretion disk mean-field alpha^2Omega-dynamo in the context of large scale disk-jet simulations. Essentially, we find the alpha-phi-dynamo component determining the amplification of the poloidal magnetic field, which is strictly related to the disk magnetization (and, as a consequence, to the jet speed, mass and collimation), while the αR and αθ-dynamo components trigger the formation of multiple, anti-aligned magnetic loops in the disk, with strong consequences on the stability and dynamics of the disk-jet system. In particular, such loops trigger the formation of dynamo inefficient zones, which are characterized by a weak magnetic field, and therefore a lower value of the magnetic diffusivity. The jet mass, speed and collimation are strongly affected by the formation of the dynamo inefficient zones.

title: Updated predictions for gravitational waves produced in a strongly supercooled phase transition
authors: John Ellis, Marek Lewicki, Ville Vaskonen
topic: We update predictions for the gravitational wave (GW) signal from a strongly supercooled phase transition in an illustrative classically conformal U(1)B−L model. We implement prop gamma^2 scaling of the friction on the bubble wall and update the estimates for the efficiency factors for GW production from bubble collisions and plasma-related sources. We take into account the fact that a small decay rate of the symmetry-breaking field may lead to brief matter-dominated era after the transition, as the field oscillates around its minimum before decaying.  We find that a strong bubble collision signal occurs in a significant part of the parameter space, and that the modified redshift of the modes that re-enter the horizon during the matter-dominated period generates a characteristic tilted `plateau' in the spectrum.

title: Confirmed width-Eiso and width-Liso relations in GRB: comparison with the Amati and Yonetoku relations
authors: Zhao-Yang Peng, Yue Yin, Ting Li, Hui Wu, Dao-Zhou Wang
topic: In this paper, we select a sample including 141 BEST time-integrated F spectra and 145 BEST peak flux P spectra observed by the Konus-Wind with known redshift to recheck the connection between the spectral width and Eiso as well as Liso. We define six types of absolute spectral widths. It is found that all of the rest-frame absolute spectral widths are strongly positive correlated with Eiso as well as Liso for the long burst for both the F and P spectra. All of the short bursts are the outliers for width-Eiso relation and most of the short bursts are consistent with the long bursts for the width-Liso relation for both F and P spectra.

topic: We report on the gravitational wave signal computed in the context of a three-dimensional simulation of a core collapse supernova explosion of a 15 Solar mass star. The simulation was performed with our neutrino hydrodynamics code Chimera. We detail the gravitational wave strains as a function of time, for both polarizations, and discuss their physical origins. We also present the corresponding spectral signatures. Gravitational wave emission in our model has two key features: low-frequency emission (less 200 Hz) emanates from the gain layer as a result of neutrino-driven convection and the SASI and high-frequency emission (> 600 Hz) emanates from the proto-neutron star due to Ledoux convection within it. The high-frequency emission dominates the gravitational wave emission in our model and emanates largely from the convective layer itself, not from the convectively stable layer above it, due to convective overshoot. Moreover, the low-frequency emission emanates from the gain layer itself, not from the proto-neutron star, due to accretion onto it. We provide evidence of the SASI in our model and demonstrate that the peak of our low-frequency gravitational wave emission spectrum corresponds to it.

title: Magnetic fields in late-stage proto-neutron stars
authors: S. K. Lander, P. Haensel, B. Haskell, J. L. Zdunik, M. Fortin
topic: We explore the thermal and magnetic-field structure of a late-stage proto-neutron star. We find the dominant contribution to the entropy in different regions of the star, from which we build a simplified equation of state for the hot neutron star. With this, we numerically solve the stellar equilibrium equations to find a range of models, including magnetic fields and rotation up to Keplerian velocity. We argue that the equation of state is effectively barotropic for this problem. For fixed magnetic-field strength, the induced ellipticity increases with temperature; we give quantitative formulae for this. The Keplerian velocity is considerably lower for hotter stars, which may set a de-facto maximum rotation rate for non-recycled NSs well below 1 kHz. The qualitative magnetic-field structure is similar for hot and cold stars, with the poloidal field component dominating over the toroidal one; we argue this result may be universal. We show that truncating magnetic-field solutions at low multipoles leads to serious inaccuracies, especially for models with rapid rotation or a strong toroidal-field component.

title: Gravitational wave background from extreme mass ratio inspirals
authors: Matteo Bonetti, Alberto Sesana
topic: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), i.e. binary systems comprised by a compact stellar-mass object orbiting a massive black hole, are expected to be among the primary gravitational wave (GW) sources for the forthcoming LISA mission. The astrophysical processes leading to the formation of such systems still remain poorly understood, resulting into large uncertainties in the predicted cosmic rate of these sources, spanning at least three orders of magnitude. As LISA can individually resolve mostly EMRIs up to z≳1, the ensemble of signals below its detection threshold will add up incoherently forming an unresolved confusion noise, which can be formally described as a stochastic background. We perform an extensive study of this background by considering a collection of astrophysically motivated EMRI formation scenarios, spanning current uncertainties. We find that in fiducial EMRI models -- predicting hundreds of EMRI detections during mission operations -- a significant background comparable to the LISA noise emerges, affecting the performance of the instrument around 3 mHz. In extreme cases, this background can even "erase" the whole LISA sensitivity bucket in the 2-10 mHz frequency range

title: A coupled guiding center-Boris particle pusher for magnetized plasmas in compact-object magnetospheres
authors: Fabio Bacchini, Bart Ripperda, Alexander A. Philippov, Kyle Parfrey
topic: We present a novel numerical scheme for simulating the motion of relativistic charged particles in magnetospheres of compact objects, typically filled with highly magnetized collisionless plasmas. The new algorithm is based on a dynamic switch between the full system of equations of motion and a guiding center approximation. The switch between the two formulations is based on the magnetization of the plasma particles, such that the dynamics are accurately captured by the guiding center motion even when the gyro-frequency is under-resolved by the time step. For particles with a large gyro-radius, due to acceleration in, e.g., reconnecting current sheets, the algorithm adaptively switches to solve the full equations of motion instead. The new scheme is directly compatible with standard Particle-in-Cell codes, and is readily applicable in curved spacetimes via a dedicated covariant formulation.

title: Magnetic field fluctuations in anisotropic, supersonic turbulence
authors: James R. Beattie, Christoph Federrath, Amit Seta
topic: The rich structure that we observe in molecular clouds is due to the interplay between strong magnetic fields and supersonic (turbulent) velocity fluctuations. The velocity fluctuations interact with the magnetic field, causing it too to fluctuate. Using numerical simulations, we explore the nature of such magnetic field fluctuations  over a wide range of turbulent Mach numbers (i.e., from weak to strong compressibility), and Alfven Mach numbers (i.e., from strong to weak magnetic mean fields, B0) We derive a compressible quasi-static fluctuation model from the magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations and show that velocity gradients parallel to the mean magnetic field give rise to compressible modes in sub-Alfvénic flows, which prevents the flow from becoming two-dimensional, as is the case in incompressible MHD turbulence.

authors: Nipuni T. Palliyaguru, Devansh Agarwal, Golnoosh Golpayegani, Ryan Lynch, Duncan R. Lorimer, Benjamin Nguyen, Alessandra Corsi, Sarah Burke-Spolaor
topic: The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) still remains a mystery, even with the increased number of discoveries in the last three years. Growing evidence suggests that some FRBs may originate from magnetars. Large, single-dish telescopes such as Arecibo Observatory (AO) and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) have the sensitivity to detect FRB~121102-like bursts at gigaparsec distances. Here we present searches using AO and GBT that aimed to find potential radio bursts at 11 sites of past γ--ray bursts that show evidence for the birth of a magnetar. We also performed a search towards GW170817, which has a merger remnant whose nature remains uncertain

title: Diverse Jet Structures Consistent with the Off-axis Afterglow of GRB 170817A
authors: Kazuya Takahashi, Kunihito Ioka
topic: The jet structure of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been controversial after the detection of GRB 170817A as the electromagnetic counterparts to the gravitational wave event GW170817. Different authors use different jet structures for calculating the afterglow light curves. We formulated a method to inversely reconstruct the jet structure uniquely from a given off-axis GRB afterglow, without assuming any functional form of the structure. By systematically applying our inversion method, we find that more diverse jet structures are consistent with the observed afterglow of GRB 170817A within errors: such as hollow-cone, spindle, Gaussian, and power-law jet structures. In addition, the total energy of the reconstructed jet is arbitrary, proportional to the ambient density n0, with keeping the same jet shape if the parameters satisfy the degeneracy combination

title: Convective turbulent viscosity acting on equilibrium tidal flows: new frequency scaling of the effective viscosity
authors: Craig D. Duguid, Adrian J. Barker, Chris A. Jones
topic: Turbulent convection is thought to act as an effective viscosity (νE) in damping tidal flows in stars and giant planets. However, the efficiency of this mechanism has long been debated, particularly in the regime of fast tides, when the tidal frequency (ω) exceeds the turnover frequency of the dominant convective eddies (ωc). We present the results of hydrodynamical simulations to study the interaction between tidal flows and convection in a small patch of a convection zone. These simulations build upon our prior work by simulating more turbulent convection in larger horizontal boxes, and here we explore a wider range of parameters.

title: Does elasticity stabilise a magnetic neutron star?
authors: Prasanta Bera, D. I. Jones, Nils Andersson
topic: The configuration of the magnetic field in the interior of a neutron star is mostly unknown from observations. Theoretical models of the interior magnetic field geometry tend to be oversimplified to avoid mathematical complexity and tend to be based on axisymmetric barotropic fluid systems. These static magnetic equilibrium configurations have been shown to be unstable on a short time scale against an infinitesimal perturbation. Given this instability, it is relevant to consider how more realistic neutron star physics affects the outcome. In particular, it makes sense to ask if elasticity, which provides an additional restoring force on the perturbations, may stabilise the system. It is well-known that the matter in the neutron star crust forms an ionic crystal. The interactions between the crystallized nuclei can generate shear stress against any applied strain. To incorporate the effect of the crust on the dynamical evolution of the perturbed equilibrium structure, we study the effect of elasticity on the instability of an axisymmetric magnetic star. In particular we determine the critical shear modulus required to prevent magnetic instability and consider the corresponding astrophysical consequences.

title: The Fate of the Merger Remnant in GW170817 and its Imprint on the Jet Structure
authors: Ariadna Murguia-Berthier, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Fabio De Colle, Agnieszka Janiuk, Stephan Rosswog, William H. Lee
topic: The first neutron star binary merger detected in gravitational waves, GW170817 and the subsequent detection of its emission across the electromagnetic spectrum showed that these systems are viable progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRB). The afterglow signal of GW170817 has been found to be consistent with a structured GRB jet seen off-axis, requiring significant amounts of relativistic material at large angles. This trait can be attributed to the interaction of the relativistic jet with the external wind medium. Here we perform numerical simulations of relativistic jets interacting with realistic wind environments in order to explore how the properties of the wind and central engine affect the structure of successful jets. We find that the angular energy distribution of the jet depends primarily on the ratio between the lifetime of the jet and the time it takes the merger remnant to collapse. We make use of these simulations to constrain the time it took for the merger remnant in GW170817 to collapse into a black hole based on the angular structure of the jet as inferred from afterglow observations. We conclude that the lifetime of the merger remnant in GW170817 was ≈0.8−0.9s, which, after collapse, triggered the formation of the jet.

authors: Peter Anninos, P. Chris Fragile
topic: We report on recent upgrades to our general relativistic radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code, Cosmos++, which expands the two-moment, M1, radiation treatment from grey to multi-frequency transport, including Doppler and gravitational frequency shifts. The solver accommodates either photon (Bose-Einstein) or neutrino (Fermi-Dirac) statistical distribution functions with absorption, emission, and elastic scattering processes. An implicit scheme is implemented to simultaneously solve the primitive inversion problem together with the radiation-matter coupling source terms, providing stability over a broad range of opacities and optical depths where the interactions terms can be stiff. We discuss our formulations and numerical methods, and validate our methods against a wide variety of test problems spanning optically thin to thick regimes in flat, weakly curved, and strongly curved spacetimes.

authors: James H. Gillanders, Stuart A. Sim, Stephen J. Smartt
topic: We present detailed spectroscopic analysis of the extraordinarily fast-evolving transient AT2018kzr. The transient's observed lightcurve showed a rapid decline rate, comparable to the kilonova AT2017gfo. We calculate a self-consistent sequence of radiative transfer models (using TARDIS) and determine that the ejecta material is dominated by intermediate-mass elements (O, Mg and Si), with a photospheric velocity of ∼12000-14500km/s. The early spectra have the unusual combination of being blue but dominated by strong FeII and FeIII absorption features. We show that this combination is only possible with a high Fe content (3.5%). This implies a high Fe/(Ni+Co) ratio.

title: Superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction in non-homogeneous neutron star interiors
authors: Marco Antonelli, Brynmor Haskell
topic: Understanding the average motion of a multitude of superfluid vortices in the interior of a neutron star is a key ingredient for most theories of pulsar glitches. In this paper we propose a kinetic approach to compute the mutual friction force that is responsible for the momentum exchange between the normal and superfluid components in a neutron star, where the mutual friction is extracted from a suitable average over the motion of many vortex lines. As a first step towards a better modelling of the repinning and depinning processes of many vortex lines in a neutron star, we consider here only straight and non-interacting vortices: we adopt a minimal model for the dynamics of an ensemble of point vortices in two dimensions immersed in a non-homogeneous medium that acts as a pinning landscape.

title: The structure of weakly-magnetized gamma-ray burst jets
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Omer Bromberg, Chandra B. Singh, Ehud Nakar
topic: The interaction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets with the dense media into which they are launched promote the growth of local hydrodynamic instabilities along the jet boundary. In a companion paper (Gottlieb2020b) we study the evolution of hydrodynamic (unmagnetized) jets, finding that mixing of jet-cocoon material gives rise to an interface layer, termed jet-cocoon interface (JCI), which contains a significant fraction of the system energy. We find that the angular structure of the jet + JCI, when they reach the homologous phase, can be approximated by a flat core (the jet) + a power-law function (the JCI) with indices that depend on the degree of mixing. In this paper we examine the effect of subdominant toroidal magnetic fields on the jet evolution and morphology. We find that weak fields can stabilize the jet against local instabilities. The suppression of the mixing diminishes the JCI and thus reshapes the jet's post-breakout structure.

topic: Determination of a magnetic field structure on a neutron star (NS) surface is an important problem of a modern astrophysics. In a presence of strong magnetic fields a thermal conductivity of a degenerate matter is anisotropic. In this paper we present 3D anisotropic heat transfer simulations in outer layers of magnetized NSs, and construct synthetic thermal light curves. We have used a different from previous works tensorial thermal conductivity coefficient of electrons, derived from the analytical solution of the Boltzmann equation by the Chapman-Enskog method. We have obtained a NS surface temperature distribution in presence of dipole-plus-quadrupole magnetic fields. We consider a case, in which magnetic axes of a dipole and quadrupole components of the magnetic field are not aligned.

title: On the maximum mass of neutron stars and GW190814
authors: Daniel A. Godzieba, David Radice, Sebastiano Bernuzzi
topic: Motivated by the recent discovery of a compact object with mass in the range 2.5−2.67M⊙ in the binary merger GW190814, we revisit the question of the maximum mass of neutron stars (NSs). We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to generate about 2 million phenomenological equations of state with and without first order phase transitions. We fix the crust equation of state and only assume causality at higher densities. We derive strict upper bounds on the maximum mass of NSs that depend on bulk properties of NSs, such as the radii and the tidal deformabilities of reference NSs. We find that the presence of a NS in GW190814 is not inconsistent with present astronomical constraints on the NS equation of state, but could be ruled out with near-future NICER and/or LIGO/Virgo observations.

title: Alfvén wave mode conversion in pulsar magnetospheres
authors: Yajie Yuan, Yuri Levin, Ashley Bransgrove, Alexander Philippov
topic: The radio emission anomaly coincident with the 2016 glitch of the Vela pulsar may be caused by a star quake that launches Alfvén waves into the magnetosphere, disturbing the original radio emitting region. To quantify the lifetime of the Alfvén waves, we investigate a possible energy loss mechanism, the conversion of Alfvénwaves into fast magnetosonic waves. Using axisymmetric force-free simulations, we follow the propagation of Alfvén waves launched from the stellar surface with small amplitude into the closed zone of a force-free dipolar pulsar magnetosphere. We observe mode conversion happening in the ideal force-free regime. The conversion efficiency during the first passage of the Alfvén wave through the equator can be large, for waves that reach large amplitudes as they travel away from the star, or propagate on the field lines passing close to the Y-point.

title: Nuclear pasta in hot and dense matter and its influence on the equation of state for astrophysical simulations
authors: Fan Ji, Jinniu Hu, Shishao Bao, Hong Shen
topic: We explore the properties of nuclear pasta appearing in supernova matter, i.e., matter at finite temperature with a fixed proton fraction. The pasta phases with a series of geometric shapes are studied using the compressible liquid-drop (CLD) model, where nuclear matter separates into a dense liquid phase of nucleons and a dilute gas phase of nucleons and α particles. The equilibrium conditions for two coexisting phases are derived by minimization of the total free energy including the surface and Coulomb contributions, which are clearly different from the Gibbs conditions for phase equilibrium due to the finite-size effects. Compared to the results considering only spherical nuclei, the inclusion of pasta phases can delay the transition to uniform matter and enlarge the region of nonuniform matter in the phase diagram. The thermodynamic quantities obtained in the present calculation with the CLD model are consistent with those in the realistic equation of state table for astrophysical simulations using the Thomas--Fermi approximation.

title: The different flavors of extragalactic jets: the role of relativistic flow deceleration
authors: P. Rossi, G. Bodo, S. Massaglia, A. Capetti
topic: We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations of relativistic (with a Lorentz factor of 10), non magnetized jets propagating in a uniform density environment, in order to study the effect of the entrainment and the consequent deceleration. Our simulations investigate the jet propagation inside the galaxy core, where, most likely, the deceleration occurs more efficiently. We compare cases with different density and pressure ratios with respect to the ambient medium finding that low density jets are efficiently decelerated and reach a quasi steady state in which, over a length of 600 jet radii, slow down from highly to sub-relativistic velocities. At the opposite, denser jets keep highly relativistic velocity over the same length. We discuss these results in relation to the Faranoff Riley (FR) radio-sources classification. We infer that lower density jets can give rise to FR 0 and FR I radio-sources, while higher density jets may be connected to FR II radio-sources.

title: Primordial black hole origin for thermal gamma-ray bursts
authors: Oscar del Barco
topic: A binary black hole (BH) astrophysical scenario where a mass-constrained primordial black hole (PBH) undergoes a spiral fall onto its heavier component (such as a supermassive black hole (SMBH)) is described as an intense gamma-ray emission event. As the infalling BH approaches the Schwarschild surface of its companion, the PBH evaporation rate becomes more strongly enhanced due to the PBH blueshifted emission towards the SMBH, until a complete evaporation occurs before reaching the central BH horizon. Accordingly, our numerically calculated PBH flux density F(nu) and nuF(nu)ν fluence spectrum show an increasing Planck-like spectral dependence consistent with the first instants of thermal-dominant gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), providing a plausible confirmation of such low-mass primordial ultracompact objects.

We apply a baseline test of this method to the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and find [large uncertanty] demonstrating the improvement on constraints when using multiple gravitational wave events. We also confirm the results of other works that adopt this method, showing that increasing the LB threshold enhances the posterior structure and slightly shifts the distribution's peak to higher H0 values.

title: Jet Propagation in Expanding Medium for Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Hamid Hamidani, Kunihito Ioka
topic: The binary neutron star (BNS) merger event GW170817 clearly shows that a BNS merger launches a short Gamma-Ray Burst (sGRB) jet. Unlike collapsars, where the ambient medium is static, in BNS mergers the jet propagates through the merger ejecta that is expanding outward at substantial velocities (∼0.2c). Here, we present semi-analytic and analytic models to solve the propagation of GRB jets through their surrounding media. We also perform a series of 2D numerical simulations of jet propagation in BNS mergers and in collapsars to test our models. Our models are consistent with numerical simulations in every aspect (the jet head radius, the cocoon's lateral width, the jet opening angle including collimation, the cocoon pressure, and the jet-cocoon morphology). The energy composition of the cocoon is found to be different depending on whether the ambient medium is expanding or not; in the case of BNS merger jets, the cocoon energy is dominated by kinetic energy, while it is dominated by internal energy in collapsars. Our model will be useful for estimating electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves.

title: Secondary component of gravitational-wave signal GW190814 as an anisotropic neutron star
authors: Zacharias Roupas
topic: The gravitational-wave signal GW190814 involves a compact object with mass (2.50−2.67)Msun within the so-called low mass gap. As yet, a general consensus on its nature, being a black hole, a neutron star or an exotic star, has not been achieved. We investigate the possibility this compact object to be an anisotropic neutron star. Anisotropies in a neutron star core arise naturally by effects such as superfluidity, hyperons, strong magnetic fields and allow the maximum mass to exceed that of the ideally isotropic stars. We consider the Krori-Barua ansatz to model an anisotropic core and constrain the equation of state with LIGO/Virgo observations GW170817 and GW190814.

title: Massive neutron stars with multiquark cores
authors: Sitthichai Pinkanjanarod, Piyabut Burikham
topic: In the core of NS, it is possible that the density and pressure become so large that the nuclear matter undergoes phase transition into a deconfined phase, consisting of quarks and gluons and their colour bound states. Even though the quark-gluon plasma has been observed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions\cite{Gyulassy, Andronic}, it is still unclear whether exotic quark matter exists inside neutron stars. Recently the result from the combination of various perturbative theoretical calculations with astronomical observations\cite{Demorest, Antoniadis} shows that (exotic) quark matter could exist inside the cores of neutron stars above 2.0 solar masses (Msun)~\cite{Annala:2019puf} However, due to the nonperturbative characteristic of interactions between quarks and gluons in the deconfined phase, perturbative QCD~(pQCD) has limitation due to the possibly large coupling of the quark-gluon soup in such dense environment. We revisit the holographic model in Ref.~\cite{bch, bhp} and implement the equation of states~(EoS) of multiquark nuclear matter interpolating from the high-density pQCD EoS and matching with the nuclear EoS known at low densities.

authors: S. Walsh, S. McBreen, A. Martin-Carrillo, T. Dauser, N. Wijers, J. Wilms, J. Schaye, D. Barret
topic: At low redshifts, the observed baryonic density falls far short of the total number of baryons predicted. Cosmological simulations suggest that these baryons reside in filamentary gas structures, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). As a result of the high temperatures of these filaments, the matter is highly ionised such that it absorbs and emits far-UV and soft X-ray photons. Athena, the proposed European Space Agency X-ray observatory, aims to detect the `missing' baryons in the WHIM up to redshifts of z=1 through absorption in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra, allowing for the study of the evolution of these large-scale structures of the Universe. This work simulates WHIM filaments in the spectra of GRB X-ray afterglows with Athena using the SImulation of X-ray TElescopes (SIXTE) framework.

topic: In this undergraduate project, f-mode oscillations in neutron stars are used to constrain the equation of state of dense matter. For the first time, a systematic investigation of the role of nuclear saturation parameters on the mode oscillations is performed. It is found that the uncertainty in the determination of effective nucleon mass plays the most significant role in controlling the f-mode frequencies. Correlations of the frequencies with astrophysical observables relevant for asteroseismology are also investigated. Future detection of f-mode frequencies could then provide a unique way of constraining nuclear empirical parameters and therefore the behaviour of dense matter.

We use density functional theory with functionals that have been tuned to the properties of Lambda hypernuclei as well as astrophysical constraints placed by the masses of the most massive millisecond pulsars, the mass-radius range inferred from the NICER experiment, and the binary neutron star merger event GW170817. We compute general-relativistic static and maximally rotating Keplerian configurations of purely nucleonic and hypernuclear stars. We find that while nucleonic stars are broadly consistent with a neutron star being involved in GW190814, this would imply no new degrees of freedom in the dense matter up to 6.5 times the nuclear saturation density. Allowing for hyperonization of dense matter, we find that the maximal masses of hypernuclear stars, even for maximal rapidly rotating configurations, are inconsistent with a stellar nature interpretation of the light companion in GW190814, implying that this event involved two black holes rather than a neutron star and a black hole.

title: Structure of Quark Star: A Comparative Analysis of Bayesian Inference and Neural Network based modelling
authors: Silvia Traversi, Prasanta Char
topic: In this work, we compare two powerful parameter estimation methods namely Bayesian inference and Neural Network based learning to study the quark matter equation of state with constant speed of sound parametrization and the structure of the quark stars within the two-family scenario. We use the mass and radius estimations from several X-ray sources and also the mass and tidal deformability measurements from gravitational wave events to constrain the parameters of our model. The results found from the two methods are consistent. The predicted speed of sound is compatible with the conformal limit.

title: Anisotropic Neutron Stars Modelling: Constraints in Krori-Barua Spacetime
authors: Zacharias Roupas, Gamal G. L. Nashed
topic: Dense nuclear matter is expected to be anisotropic due to effects such as solidification, superfluidity, strong magnetic fields, hyperons, pion-condesation. Therefore an anisotropic pulsars core seems more realistic than an ideally isotropic one. We model anisotropic neutron stars working in the Krori-Barua (KB) ansatz without preassuming an equation of state. We show that the physics of general KB solutions is encapsulated in the compactness. Imposing physical and stability requirements yields a maximum allowed compactness. We further input observational data from numerous pulsars and calculate the boundary density. We focus especially on data from the LIGO/Virgo collaboration as well as recent independent measurements of mass and radius of miilisecond pulsars with white dwarf companions by the \textit{Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer} (NICER).

authors: I. O. Eya, C. I. Eze, E. U. Iyida
topic: The angular momentum transfer mechanism of pulsar glitches for over four decades now stands as standalone theory with regards to glitch sizes and inter-glitch time intervals. However, recent analyses both analytic and statistical are on the verge of suppressing the theory. In this paper, we overviewed the superfluid theory to highlight the efficacy of the angular momentum process and highlighted the theoretical and observational evidences that could not be explained by processes involving transfer of angular momentum.

title: Bao-Minh Hoang, Smadar Naoz, Kyle Kremer
authors: LIGO's third observing run (O3) has reported several neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger candidates. From a theoretical point of view, NSBH mergers have received less attention in the community than either binary black holes (BBHs), or binary neutron stars (BNSs). Here we examine single-single (sin-sin) gravitational wave (GW) captures in different types of star clusters -- galactic nuclei (GN), globular clusters (GC), and young stellar clusters (YSC) -- and compare the merger rates from this channel to other proposed merger channels in the literature. There are currently large uncertainties associated with every merger channel, making a definitive conclusion about the origin of NSBH mergers impossible. However, keeping these uncertainties in mind, we find that sin-sin GW capture is unlikely to significantly contribute to the overall NSBH merger rate. In general, it appears that isolated binary evolution in the field or in clusters, and dynamically interacting binaries in triple configurations, may result in a higher merger rate.

title: The Sound of Clearing the Throat: Gravitational Waves from a Black Hole Orbiting in a Wormhole Geometry
authors: James B. Dent, William E. Gabella, Kelly Holley-Bockelmann, Thomas W. Kephart
topic: Current ground-based gravitational wave detectors are tuned to capture the collision of compact objects such as stellar origin black holes and neutron stars; over 20 such events have been published to date. Theoretically, however, more exotic compact objects may exist, collisions of which should also generate copious gravitational waves. In this paper, we model the inspiral of a stellar mass black hole into a stable, non-spinning, traversable wormhole, and find a characteristic waveform -- an anti-chirp and/or burst -- as the black hole emerges, i.e., outspirals, into our region of the Universe. This novel waveform signature may be useful in searches for wormholes in future gravitational wave data or used to constrain possible wormhole geometries in our Universe.

title: GW190814 as a massive rapidly-rotating neutron star with exotic degrees of freedom
authors: V. Dexheimer, R.O. Gomes, T. Klähn, S. Han, M. Salinas
topic: In the context of the massive secondary object recently observed in the compact-star merger GW190814, we investigate the possibility of producing massive neutron stars from equation of state models that contain exotic degrees of freedom, such as hyperons and quarks. Our work shows that state-of-the-art relativistic mean field models can generate massive stars reaching geq 2.05 MSun, while being in good agreement with gravitational-wave events and x-ray pulsar observations, when quark vector interactions and higher-order self-vector interactions are introduced. When rapid rotation is added, our models generate stellar masses that approach, and in some cases surpass 2.5 MSun. We find that in such cases fast rotation does not necessarily suppress exotic degrees of freedom due to changes in stellar central density compared to non-rotating cases.

title: Simulating jets from a neutron star companion hours after a core collapse supernova
authors: Muhammad Akashi, Noam Soker 
topic: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore the interaction of jets that a neutron star (NS) companion to a type Ic or type Ib core collapse supernova (CCSN) launches few hours after explosion with the ejecta of the CCSN. We assume that a NS companion at 5Ro from the exploding star accretes mass from the slower inner ejecta through an accretion disk, and that the disk launches two opposite jets. Although the energy of the jets is only about one per cent of the total energy of the ejecta, it is comparable to the energy of the slower inner part of the ejecta. We find that the jets inflate one low-density hot bubble to one side of the ejecta, and that this bubble expands to influence ejecta gas up to expansion velocities of v(ej)=3500 km/s. The post-shock jets' material develops a large meridional flow and small vortexes. The boundary between the ejecta and jets' post-shock gases is unstable. The instabilities and vortexes mix jets' gas with the ejecta. We expect such a hot bubble to contribute to the light curve of CCSNe that are progenitors of binary NS systems, in particular to observers on the side of the bubble.

title: Inverse energy transfer in decaying, three dimensional, nonhelical magnetic turbulence due to magnetic reconnection
authors: Pallavi Bhat, Muni Zhou, Nuno F. Loureiro
topic: It has been recently shown numerically that there exists an inverse transfer of magnetic energy in decaying, nonhelical, magnetically dominated, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in 3-dimensions (3D). We suggest that magnetic reconnection is the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this inverse transfer. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, the inverse transfer is easily inferred to be due to smaller magnetic islands merging to form larger ones via reconnection. We find that the scaling behaviour is similar between the 2D and the 3D cases, i.e., the magnetic energy evolves as t−1, and the magnetic power spectrum follows a slope of k−2.

title: Magnetic field transport in compact binaries
authors: Nicolas Scepi, Geoffroy Lesur, Guillaume Dubus, Jonatan Jacquemin-Ide
topic: Dwarf novae (DNe) and low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) show eruptions that are thought to be due to a thermal-viscous instability in their accretion disk. These eruptions provide constraints on angular momentum transport mechanisms. We explore the idea that angular momentum transport could be controlled by the dynamical evolution of the large scale magnetic field. We study the impact of different prescriptions for the magnetic field evolution on the dynamics of the disk. This is a first step in confronting the theory of magnetic field transport with observations. We develop a version of the disk instability model that evolves the density, the temperature and the large scale vertical magnetic flux together. We take into account the accretion driven by turbulence or by a magnetized outflow. To evolve the magnetic flux, we use a toy model with physically motivated prescriptions depending mainly on the local magnetization. We find that allowing magnetic flux to be advected inwards provides the best agreement with DNe lightcurves.

authors: Paz Beniamini, Pawan Kumar
topic: Light-curve variability timescales, the small ratio of rise time of the flux to pulse duration, and the spectro-temporal correlations in the data constrain the compactness of the source and the mechanism responsible for the powerful radio emission. The constraints are strongest when radiation is produced far (less 1010cm) from the compact object. We describe different physical set-ups that can account for the observed despite having large emission radii.

title: Gravitational Waves from Neutrino Asymmetries in Core-Collapse Supernovae
authors: David Vartanyan, Adam Burrows
topic: We present a broadband spectrum of gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) sourced by neutrino emission asymmetries for a series of full 3D simulations. The associated gravitational wave strain probes the long-term secular evolution of CCSNe and small-scale turbulent activity and provides insight into the geometry of the explosion. For non-exploding models, both the neutrino luminosity and the neutrino gravitational waveform will encode information about the spiral SASI. The neutrino memory will be detectable for a wide range of progenitor masses for a galactic event. Our results can be used to guide near-future decihertz and long-baseline gravitational-wave detection programs, including aLIGO, the Einstein Telescope, and DECIGO.

title: Near-infrared emission lines trace the state-independent accretion disc wind of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070
authors: Javier Sánchez-Sierras, Teo Muñoz-Darias
topic: The black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 displayed optical P-Cyg profiles and other wind-related emission line features during the hard state of its discovery outburst. We present near-infrared (nIR) spectroscopy covering the different accretion states of the system during this event. Our 8-epoch data set (VLT/X-shooter) reveals strong variability in the properties of the nIR emission lines. This includes the presence of absorption troughs and extended emission line wings with kinetic properties that are remarkably similar to those inferred from the wind signatures observed in optical emission lines, indicating that they are most likely tracing the same accretion disc wind. Unlike the optical features, these nIR signatures are not exclusive of the hard state, as they are also witnessed across the soft state with similar observational properties. This supports the presence of a relatively steady outflow during the entire outburst of the system, and represents the first detection of an accretion disc wind in a black hole soft state at energies other than X-rays. We discuss the visibility of the wind as a function of the spectral band and the potential of nIR spectroscopy for wind studies, in particular during luminous accretion phases.

title: Gravitational-wave selection effects using neural-network classifiers
authors: Davide Gerosa, Geraint Pratten, Alberto Vecchio
topic: We present a novel machine-learning approach to estimate selection effects in gravitational-wave observations. Using techniques similar to those commonly employed in image classification and pattern recognition, we train a series of neural-network classifiers to predict the LIGO/Virgo detectability of gravitational-wave signals from compact-binary mergers. We include the effect of spin precession, higher-order modes, and multiple detectors and show that their omission, as it is common in large population studies, tends to overestimate the inferred merger rate in selected regions of the parameter space. Although here we train our classifiers using a simple signal-to-noise ratio threshold, our approach is ready to be used in conjunction with full pipeline injections, thus paving the way toward including actual distributions of astrophysical and noise triggers into gravitational-wave population analyses.

title: Can we trust MHD jump conditions for collisionless shocks?
authors: Antoine Bret
topic: When applied to compute the density jump of a shock, the standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) formalism assumes, 1) that all the upstream material passes downstream, together with the momentum and energy it carries, and 2) that pressures are isotropic. In a collisionless shock, shock accelerated particles going back and forth around the front can invalid the first assumption. In addition, an external magnetic field can sustain stable pressure anisotropies, invaliding the second assumption. It is therefore unclear whether the density jump of a collisionless shock fulfils the MHD jump or not.
Here we try to clarify this issue. A literature review is conducted on 68 articles dealing with Particle-In-Cell simulations of collisionless shocks. We analyze the factors triggering departure from the MHD density jump. In the strong field limit and for parallel shocks, the departure caused by the field saturates at a finite, negative, value. For perpendicular shocks, the departure goes to zero at small and high σ's so that we find here a departure window. The results obtained have to be checked against full 3D simulations.

title: Computational General Relativistic Force-Free Electrodynamics: II. Characterization of Numerical Diffusivity
authors: J. F. Mahlmann, M. A. Aloy, V. Mewes, P. Cerdá-Durán
topic: Scientific codes are an indispensable link between theory and experiment; in (astro-)plasma physics, such numerical tools are one window into the universe's most extreme flows of energy. The discretization of Maxwell's equations - needed to make highly magnetized (astro)physical plasma amenable to its numerical modeling - introduces numerical diffusion. It acts as a source of dissipation independent of the system's physical constituents. Understanding the numerical diffusion of scientific codes is the key to classify their reliability. It gives specific limits in which the results of numerical experiments are physical. We aim at quantifying and characterizing the numerical diffusion properties of our recently developed numerical tool for the simulation of general relativistic force-free electrodynamics, by calibrating and comparing it with other strategies found in the literature. Our code correctly models smooth waves of highly magnetized plasma. We evaluate the limits of general relativistic force-free electrodynamics in the context of current sheets and tearing mode instabilities.

title: GW190425 and GW190814: Two candidate mergers of primordial black holes from the QCD epoch
authors: Sebastien Clesse, Juan Garcia-Bellido
topic: The two recent gravitational-wave events GW190425 and GW190814 from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo have both a companion which is unexpected if originated from a neutron star or a stellar black hole, with masses: [1.6−2.5] Msun  and [2.5−2.7] Msun. The possibility that these objects are Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) is investigated. The known thermal history of the Universe predicts that the PBH formation is boosted at the time of the QCD transition, inducing a peak in their distribution at this particular mass scale, and a bump around 30−50 M⊙. We find that the merging rates inferred from GW190425 and GW190814 are consistent with PBH binaries formed by capture in dense halos or before matter-radiation equality.

topic: Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes (MAGIC) detected the gamma-ray afterglow of GRB 190114C, which can constrain microscopic parameters of the shock-heated plasma emitting non-thermal emission. Focusing on the early afterglow of this event, we numerically simulate the spectrum and multi-wavelength light curves with constant and wind-like circumstellar medium using a time-dependent code. Our results show that the electron acceleration timescale at the highest energies is likely shorter than 20 times the gyroperiod to reproduce the GeV gamma-ray flux and its spectral index reported by {\it Fermi}. This gives an interesting constraint on the acceleration efficiency for Weibel-mediated shocks.

topic: The observation of a compact object with a mass of 2.50−2.67Msun on August 14, 2019, by the LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations (LVC) has the potential to improve our understanding of the supranuclear equation of state. While the gravitational-wave analysis of the LVC suggests that GW190814 likely was a binary black hole system, the secondary component could also have been the heaviest neutron star observed to date. We use our previously derived nuclear-physics--multi-messenger astrophysics framework to address the nature of this object. Based on our findings, we determine GW190814 to be a binary black hole merger with a probability of greater 99.9\%.

Some of these are very similar to the challenges faced by many astronomers engaging in international collaboration, for example, data access policies, funding, theoretical and computational resources and workforce equity. Others, including, alerts, telescope coordination and target-of-opportunity implementation, are strongly linked to the time domain and are particularly challenging as we respond to transients.

title: Radial oscillations and gravitational wave echoes of strange stars in various equation of states
authors: Jyatsnasree Bora, Umananda Dev Goswami
topic: We study the radial oscillations of non-rotating strange stars and their characteristic echo frequencies for three Equation of States (EoSs), viz., MIT Bag model EoS, linear EoS and polytropic EoS. The frequencies of radial oscillations of these compact stars are computed for these EoSs. 22 lowest radial frequencies for each of these three EoSs have been computed. First, for each EoS, we have integrated Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations numerically to calculate the radial and pressure perturbations of strange stars. Next, the mass-radius relationships for these stars are obtained using these three EoSs. Then the radial frequencies of oscillations for these EoSs are calculated. Further, the characteristic gravitational wave echo frequencies and the repetition of echo frequencies of strange stars are computed for these EoSs. Our numerical results show that the radial frequencies and also echo frequencies vastly depend on the model and on the value of the model parameter.

title: Revisiting constraints on the maximum neutron star mass in light of GW190814
authors: Yeunhwan Lim, Anirban Bhattacharya, Jeremy W. Holt, Debdeep Pati
topic: We investigate the maximum neutron star mass based on constraints from low-energy nuclear physics, neutron star tidal deformabilities from GW170817, and simultaneous mass-radius measurements of PSR J0030+045 from NICER. Our prior distribution is based on a combination of nuclear modeling valid in the vicinity of normal nuclear densities together with the assumption of a maximally stiff equation of state at high densities. The transition density is treated as a model parameter with uniform prior. Bayesian likelihood functions involving measured neutron star tidal deformabilities and radii are subsequently used to generate equation of state posteriors. We demonstrate that a modification of the highly uncertain supra-saturation density equation of state allows for the support of 2.5−2.6Msun neutron stars without strongly modifying the properties

title: Beyond moments: relativistic Lattice-Boltzmann methods for radiative transport in computational astrophysics
authors: L. R. Weih, A. Gabbana, D. Simeoni, L. Rezzolla, S. Succi, R. Tripiccione
topic: We present a new method for the numerical solution of the radiative-transfer equation (RTE) in multidimensional scenarios commonly encountered in computational astrophysics. The method is based on the direct solution of the Boltzmann equation via an extension of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods and allows to model the evolution of the radiation field as it interacts with a background fluid, via absorption, emission, and scattering. As a first application of this method, we restrict our attention to a frequency independent (``grey'') formulation within a special-relativistic framework, which can be employed also for classical computational astrophysics. For a number of standard tests that consider the performance of the method in optically thin, optically thick and intermediate regimes with a static fluid, we show the ability of the LB method to produce accurate and convergent results matching the analytic solutions.

title: GW190814: Spin and equation of state of a neutron star companion
authors: Antonios Tsokaros, Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: Here we explore some consequences of the assumption that the secondary was a neutron star (NS). We show with concrete examples of heretofore viable equations of state (EOSs) that rapid uniform rotation is certainly adequate to explain the existence of a stable ∼2.6Msun NS for moderately stiff EOS but may not be adequate for soft EOSs. Moreover, rotation may not even be necessary for sufficiently stiff ones. In particular, several soft EOSs favored by GW170817 and with maximum spherical masses of ∼2.1Msun \textit{cannot} be invoked to explain this object as a uniformly rotating NS. Absolute upper mass limits on the maximum spherical NS derived from GW170817 immediately suggest that this unknown compact companion can be a slowly or even a nonrotating NS. Stiff EOSs that can achieve this are neither rejected nor favored by GW170817, and they are in accord with the results of NICER.

We study the temporal and angular variations of the neutrino signals and discuss the detectability of the time variations driven by the spiral Standing Accretion Shock Instability (spiral SASI) when it emerges for non-exploding models.

This signal has the best localisation of any observed gravitational wave (GW) source. and an estimated distance of ~ 240 Mpc.  Nearby galaxies within the high probability region were targeted with the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), whereas promising candidate counterparts were characterized through multi-colour photometry with the Reionization and Transients InfraRed (RATIR) and spectroscopy with the Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC). We use our optical and near-infrared limits in conjunction with the upper limits obtained by the community to constrain the possible electromagnetic counterparts associated with the merger. A gamma-ray burst seen along its jet's axis is disfavoured by the multi-wavelength dataset, whereas the presence of a burst seen at larger viewing angles is not well constrained.

topic: Because of the development of many-body theories of nuclear matter, the long-standing, open problem of the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter may be understood in the near future through the confrontation of theoretical calculations with laboratory measurements of nuclear properties \& reactions and increasingly accurate observations in astronomy. In this review, we focus on the following six aspects: 1) providing a survey of the quark mean-field (QMF) model, which consistently describes a nucleon and many-body nucleonic system from a quark potential; 2) applying QMF to both nuclear matter and neutron stars; 3) extending QMF formalism to the description of hypernuclei and hyperon matter, as well as hyperon stars; 4) exploring the hadron-quark phase transition and hybrid stars by combining the QMF model with the quark matter model characterized by the sound speed; 5) constraining interquark interactions through both the gravitational wave signals and electromagnetic signals of binary merger event GW170817; and 6) discussing further opportunities to study dense matter EOS from compact objects, such as neutron star cooling and pulsar glitches.

authors: Ivan Tomczak, Jérôme Pétri
topic: In this paper, we discuss the results of a new particle pusher in realistic ultra-strong electromagnetic fields as those encountered around rotating neutron stars. After presenting results of this algorithm in simple fields and comparing them to expected exact analytical solutions, we present new simulations for a rotating magnetic dipole in vacuum for a millisecond pulsar by using Deutsch solution. Particles are injected within the magnetosphere, neglecting radiation reaction, interaction among them and their feedback on the fields. Our simulations are therefore not yet fully self-consistent because Maxwell equations are not solved according to the current produced by these particles. The code highlights the symmetrical behaviour of particles of opposite charge to mass ratio q/m with respect to the north and south hemispheres.

title: The Role of Magnetic Fields in Neutrino-Driven Supernovae
authors: Bernhard Müller, Vishnu Varma
topic: We study the impact of a small-scale dynamo in core-collapse supernovae using a 3D neutrino magnetohydrodynamics simulation of a 15Msun progenitor. The weak seed field is amplified exponentially in the gain region once neutrino-driven convection develops, and remains dominated by small-scale structures. About 250ms after bounce, the field energy in the gain region reaches ~50\% of kinetic equipartition. This supports the development of a neutrino-driven explosion with modest global anisotropy, which does not occur in a corresponding model without magnetic fields. Our results suggest that magnetic fields may play a beneficial subsidiary role in neutrino-driven supernovae even without rapid progenitor rotation. Further investigation into the nature of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the supernova core is required.

authors: Taylor Jacovich, Paz Beniamini, Alexander van der Horst
topic: We present a self-consistent way of modeling synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) effects in gamma-ray burst afterglows, with and without approximated Klein-Nishina suppressed scattering. We provide an analytic approximation of our results, so that it can be incorporated into the afterglow modeling code \texttt{boxfit}, which is currently based on pure synchrotron emission. We discuss the changes in spectral shape and evolution due to SSC effects, and comment on how these changes affect physical parameters derived from broadband modeling. We show that SSC effects can have a profound impact on the shape of the X-ray light curve using simulations including these effects. This leads to data that cannot be simultaneously fit well in both the X-ray and radio bands when considering synchrotron-only fits, and an inability to recover the correct physical parameters, with some fitted parameters deviating orders of magnitude from the simulated input parameters. This may have a significant impact on the physical parameter distributions based on previous broadband modeling efforts.

title: Analyzing clustering of astrophysical gravitational-wave sources: Luminosity-distance space distortions
authors: Toshiya Namikawa
topic: We present a formulation of the observed number density fluctuations of gravitational-wave (GW) sources in a three dimensional space. In GW observations, redshift identification for each GW source is a challenging issue, in particular, for high redshift sources. The use of observed luminosity distance as a distance indicator will be a simple yet optimal way for measuring the clustering signal. We derive the density fluctuations of GW sources estimated from observed luminosity distance and sky position of each source. The density fluctuations are distorted as similar to the so-called redshift space distortions in galaxy surveys but with several differences. We then show the two-point correlation function and multipole power spectrum in the presence of the distortion effect.

topic: We investigate possible correlations between neutron star observables and properties of atomic nuclei. Particularly, we explore how the tidal deformability of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star, M1.4, and the neutron skin thickness of 48Ca and 208Pb are related to the stellar radius and the stiffness of the symmetry energy. {\it Methods.} We examine a large set of nuclear equations of state based on phenomenological models (Skyrme, NLWM, DDM) and {\it ab-initio} theoretical methods (BBG, Dirac-Brueckner, Variational, Quantum Monte Carlo). {\it Results.} We find strong correlations between tidal deformability and NS radius, whereas a weaker correlation does exist with the stiffness of the symmetry energy.

topic: The discovery of a radioactively powered kilonova associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817 was the first - and still only - confirmed electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational-wave event. However, observations of late-time electromagnetic emission are in tension with the expectations from standard neutron-star merger models. Although the large measured ejecta mass is potentially explained by a progenitor system that is asymmetric in terms of the stellar component masses, i.e. with a mass ratio q of 0.7-0.8, the known Galactic population of merging double neutron star (DNS) systems (i.e. those that will coalesce within billions of years or less) has, until now, only consisted of nearly equal-mass (q>0.9) binaries.  Based on this detection, our population synthesis analysis implies that such asymmetric binaries represent between..

title: Is GW170817 a Multimessenger Neutron Star-Primordial Black Hole Merger?
authors: Yu-Dai Tsai, Antonella Palmese, Stefano Profumo, Tesla Jeltema
topic: We investigate the possibility of the gravitational-wave event GW170817 being a light, solar-mass black hole (BH) - neutron star (NS) merger. We explore two exotic scenarios involving primordial black holes (PBH) that could produce such an event, taking into account available observational information on NGC 4993. First, we entertain the possibility of dynamical NS-PBH binary formation where a solar-mass PBH and a NS form a binary through gravitational interaction. We find that while dynamical NS-PBH formation could account for the GW170817 event, the rate is highly dependent on unknown density contrast factors and could potentially be affected by galaxy mergers.

topic:Is the secondary component of GW190814 the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system? This is the central question animating this letter. Covariant density functional theory provides a unique framework to investigate both the properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars, while enforcing causality at all densities. By tuning existing energy density functionals we were able to: (a) account for a 2.6 Msun neutron star, (b) satisfy the original constraint on the tidal deformability of a 1.4 Msun neutron star, and (c) reproduce ground-state properties of finite nuclei.

Neutron star mergers are expected to often produce rapidly-rotating remnant neutron stars that emit gravitational waves. These will provide clues to the extremely hot post-merger environment. This signature of nuclear matter in gravitational waves contains most information in the 2-4 kHz frequency band, which is outside of the most sensitive band of current detectors. We present the design concept and science case for a neutron star extreme matter observatory (NEMO): a gravitational-wave interferometer optimized to study nuclear physics with merging neutron stars.

topic: The gravitational-wave event S190521g -- a likely binary black hole merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus -- was accompanied by an optical counterpart. Such dense environments around luminous energy release regions are favourable for high energy gamma-ray production. We report on a search for high energy gamma-rays from the direction of the candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the S190521g event using publicly-available data of the Fermi-LAT space gamma-ray telescope. No significant signal was found. We present upper limits on the spectral energy distribution of the source in the 100 MeV -- 300 GeV energy range. We discuss the importance of studying S190521g-like transients in the context of cosmic ray acceleration, gamma-ray and neutrino production in such sources.

title: RAPTOR II: Polarized radiative transfer in curved spacetime
authors: Thomas Bronzwaer, Ziri Younsi, Jordy Davelaar, Heino Falcke
topic: Accreting supermassive black holes are sources of polarized radiation that propagates through highly curved spacetime before reaching the observer. In order to help interpret observations of such polarized emission, accurate and efficient numerical schemes for polarized radiative transfer in curved spacetime are needed. In this manuscript we extend our publicly available radiative transfer code RAPTOR to include polarization. We provide a brief review of different codes and methods for covariant polarized radiative transfer available in the literature and existing codes, and present an efficient new scheme. For the spacetime-propagation aspect of the computation, we develop a compact, Lorentz-invariant representation of a polarized ray. For the plasma-propagation aspect of the computation, we perform a formal analysis of the stiffness of the polarized radiative-transfer equation with respect to our explicit integrator, and develop a hybrid integration scheme that switches to an implicit integrator in case of stiffness, in order to solve the equation with optimal speed and accuracy for all possible values of the local optical/Faraday thickness of the plasma.

title: Why can hadronic stars convert into strange quark stars with larger radii
authors: Alessandro Drago, Giuseppe Pagliara
topic: The total binding energy of compact stars is the sum of the gravitational binding energy (BE)g and the nuclear binding energy (BE)n, the last being related to the microphysics of the interactions. While the first is positive (binding) both for hadronic stars and for strange quark stars, the second is large and negative for hadronic stars (anti-binding) and either small and negative (anti-binding) or positive (binding) for strange quark stars. A hadronic star can convert into a strange quark star with a larger radius because the consequent reduction of (BE)g is over-compensated by the large increase in (BE)n. Thus, the total binding energy increases due to the conversion and the process is exothermic.

title: Wind-powered afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: flares, plateaus and steep decays
authors: 
topic: Afterglows of gamma-ray bursts often show flares, plateaus, and sudden intensity drops: these temporal features are difficult to explain as coming from the forward shock. We calculate radiative properties of early GRB afterglows with the dominant contribution from the reverse shock (RS) propagating in an ultra-relativistic (pulsar-like) wind produced by the long-lasting central engine. RS emission occurs in the fast cooling regime - this ensures high radiative efficiency and allows fast intensity variations. We demonstrate that: (i) mild wind power, of the order of ∼1046 erg s−1, can reproduce the afterglows' plateau phase; (ii) termination of the wind can produce sudden steep decays; (iii) mild variations in the wind luminosity can produce short-duration afterglow flares.

title: Turbulent, pinned superfluids in neutron stars and pulsar glitch recoveries
authors: Brynmor Haskell, Danai Antonopoulou, Carlo Barenghi
topic: Pulsar glitches offer an insight into the dynamics of superfluids in the high density interior of a neutron star. To model these phenomena, however, one needs to have an understanding of the dynamics of a turbulent array of superfluid vortices moving through a pinning lattice. In this paper we develop a theoretical approach to describe vortex mediated mutual friction in a pinned, turbulent and rotating superfluid. Our model is then applied to the study of the post glitch rotational evolution in the Vela pulsar and in PSR J0537-6910. We show that in both cases a turbulent model fits the evolution of the spin frequency derivative better than a laminar one. We also predict that the second derivative of the frequency after a glitch should be correlated with the waiting time since the previous glitch, which we find to be consistent with observational data for these pulsars. The main conclusion of this paper is that in the post-glitch rotational evolution of these two pulsars we are most likely observing the response to the glitch of a pinned turbulent region of the star (possibly the crust) and not the laminar response of a regular straight vortex array.

title: The mass, spin and rotational energy of the remnant black holes from compact binary mergers
authors: Can-Min Deng
topic: Recently, many gravitational wave events from compact binary mergers have been detected by LIGO. Determining the final mass and spin of the remnant black holes (RBHs) is a fundamental issue and is also important in astrophysics. In this paper, unified models for predicting the final mass and spin of the RBHs from compact binary mergers is proposed. The models achieve a good accuracy within the parameter range of interest. In addition, the rotational energy of the RBHs is also studied which is relevant to the electromagnetic counterparts of the mergers. It is found the distribution of the rotational energy of the RBHs from different types of mergers of compact binary has its own characteristics, which might help identify the electromagnetic counterparts associated with the mergers.

topic: Using Stergioulas's RNS code for investigating fast pulsars with Equation of States (EOSs) on the causality surface (where the speed of sound equals to that of light) of the high-density EOS parameter space satisfying all known constraints from both nuclear physics and astrophysics, we show that the GW190814's secondary component of mass (2.50−2.67) Msun can be a super-fast pulsar spinning faster than 971 Hz about 42\% below its Kepler frequency. There is a large and physically allowed EOS parameter space below the causality surface where pulsars heavier than 2.50 Msun are supported if they can rotate even faster with critical frequencies depending strongly on the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy.

title: Nickel clumps and light curve bumps: Light curves and spectra of models with macroscopic 56Ni clumps in the outer ejecta
authors: M. R. Magee, K. Maguire
topic: An excess of flux in the early light curves of type Ia supernovae has been observed in a few cases. Multiple scenarios have been proposed to explain this. Recently, it has been shown that for at least one object (SN 2018oh) the excess emission observed could be the result of a large-scale clump of 56Ni in the outer ejecta of ~0.03 Msun. We present model light curves and spectra for ejecta profiles containing 56Ni clumps of varying masses (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 Msun) and shapes. We find that even for our lowest mass 56Ni clump, an increase of less of eq 2 magnitudes is produced in the bolometric light curve at one day after explosion, relative to models without a 56Ni clump.

authors: Denis Nikolaevich Sob'yanin 
topic: We show that consideration of forced precession of a neutron star does not encounter the difficulty. This kind of precession takes place even if the neutron star is not deformed and is brought about by the anomalous moment of electromagnetic forces induced by stellar rotation and determined by non-corotational currents. Contrary to what is expected for the currents of corotation, the anomalous torque calculated by the direct method appears to be non-zero.

title: Discriminating between Neutron Stars and Black Holes with Imperfect Knowledge of the Maximum Neutron Star Mass
authors: Reed Essick, Philipe Landry
topic: Constructing an explicit mixture model for the total rate density of merging compact objects, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian analysis to classify gravitational-wave sources according to the posterior odds that their component masses are drawn from different subpopulations. Accounting for current uncertainty in the maximum neutron star mass, and adopting different reasonable models for the total rate density, we examine two recent events from the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration's third observing run, GW190425 and GW190814. For population models with no overlap between the neutron star and black hole mass distributions, we typically find that there is a more or equal 70 \% chance that GW190425 was a binary neutron star merger rather than a neutron-star--black-hole merger.

authors: Hou-Jun Lü, Yong Yuan, Lin Lan, Bin-Bin Zhang, Jin-Hang Zou, Zong-Kai Peng, Jun Shen, Yun-Feng Liang, Xiang-Gao Wang, En-Wei Liang
topic: Together with the EE component and early X-ray data, it exhibits a plateau emission smoothly connected with a \sim t^-1 segment, and followed by an extremely steep decay. The short GRB composed of those three segments is unique in the {\em Swift} era, and is very difficult to explain with the standard internal/external shock model of a black hole central engine, but could be consistent with the prediction of a magnetar central engine from the merger of an NS binary. We suggest that the plateau emission followed by a \sim t^-1 decay phase is powered by the spin-down of millisecond magnetar, which loses its rotation energy via GW quadrupole radiation. Then, the abrupt drop decay is caused by magnetar collapsing into black hole before switching to the EM-dominated emission.

title: Two temperature solutions and emergent spectra from relativistic accretion discs around black holes
authors: Shilpa Sarkar, Indranil Chattopadhyay, Philippe Laurent
topic: An accreting system in two-temperature regime, admits multiple solutions for the same set of constants of motion, producing widely different spectra. Comparing observed spectrum with that derived from a randomly chosen accretion solution, will give us a wrong estimation of the accretion parameters of the system. The form of entropy measure obtained by us, have helped in removing the degeneracy of the solutions, allowing us to understand the physics of the system, shorn of arbitrary assumptions. In this work, we have shown how the spectra and luminosities of an accreting system depends on the constants of motion, producing solutions ranging from radiatively inefficient flows to luminous flows. Increase in BH mass quantitatively changes the system, makes the system more luminous and the spectral bandwidth also increases. Higher BH mass system spans from radio to gamma-rays. However, increasing the accretion rate around a BH of certain mass, has little influence in the frequency range of the spectra.

Redefining the separation between r-I and r-II stars will aid in analysis of the possible progenitors of these two classes of stars and whether these signatures arise from separate astrophysical sources at all. Applying this redefinition to previous RPA data, the number of identified r-II and r-I stars changes to 51 and 121, respectively, from the initial set of data releases published thus far.

title: FIRST J1419+3940 as the First Observed Radio Flare from a Neutron Star Merger
authors: K.H. Lee, I. Bartos, G.C. Privon, J.C. Rose, P. Torrey
topic: During their violent merger, two neutron stars can shed a few percent of their mass. As this ejecta expands, it collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, producing a slowly-fading {\it radio flare} that lasts for years. Radio flares uniquely probe the neutron star merger populations as many events from past decades could still be detectable. Nonetheless, no radio flare observation has been reported to date. Here we show that the radio transient FIRST J1419+3940, first observed in 1993 and still detectable, likely originated from a neutron star merger. We carry out numerical simulations of neutron star merger ejecta to demonstrate that the observed radio light curve is well reproduced by a merger model with astrophysically expected parameters. We find that a neutron star merger model is a priori more likely and provides a better fit to the data than the alternative explanation---the afterglow of an off-axis long gamma-ray burst.

title: Post-merger Mass Ejection of Low-mass Binary Neutron Stars
authors: Sho Fujibayashi, Shinya Wanajo, Kenta Kiuchi, Koutaro Kyutoku, Yuichiro Sekiguchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: We study the post-merger mass ejection of low-mass binary neutron stars (NSs) with the system mass of 2.5M⊙, and subsequent nucleosynthesis by performing general-relativistic, neutrino-radiation viscous-hydrodynamics simulations in axial symmetry. We find that the merger remnants are long-lived massive NSs surviving more than several seconds, irrespective of the nuclear equations of state (EOSs) adopted.  Post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that the ejecta is composed mainly of light r-process nuclei with small amounts of lanthanides. Such abundance distributions are incompatible with the solar r-process-like abundance patterns found in all measured r-process-enhanced metal-poor stars. Therefore, low-mass binary NS mergers should be rare. If such low-mass NS mergers occur, their electromagnetic counterparts, kilonovae, will be characterized by an early bright blue emission because of the large ejecta mass as well as the small lanthanide fraction. We also show, however, that if the effective turbulent viscosity is very high, or there is an efficient mass ejection working in the early post-merger phase, the electron fraction of the ejecta could be low enough that the solar r-process-like abundance pattern is reproduced and the lanthanide fraction becomes so high that the kilonova would be characterized by early bright blue and late bright red emissions.

authors: Shabnam Iyyani, Vidushi Sharma
topic: The prompt emission of short gamma ray bursts (sGRBs) with known redshifts are analyzed using the model of multi-color blackbody which is interpreted as the emission from a non-dissipative photosphere taking into account the structure and the viewing geometry of the jet. We find nearly 69% and 26% of the sample are consistent with multi-color blackbody and a pure blackbody model, respectively. We find that nearly 57\%(18\%) of the sGRBs in our sample are observed within (or along the edge of) the jet cone. The sGRB jets are found to be very narrow with the most probable value of the jet opening angle, θj=2pm1 deg. This gives the rate of sGRBs that would be viewed within the jet cone to be 0.2−4.4Gpc−3yr−1. The intrinsic luminosity are found to range between 1048−1053erg/s. The average values of Lorentz factor and nozzle radius of the sGRB jets are found to be 210(85) and 107.7(109.6)cm for the cases when the photosphere forms in the coasting (accelerating) phase respectively.

title: Revisiting primordial black holes capture into neutron stars
authors: Yoann Génolini, Pasquale Serpico, Peter Tinyakov
topic: Primordial black holes (PBH), produced through a variety of processes in the early universe, could fill galactic halos accounting for a fraction or the totality of the dark matter. In particular, PBH with sub-stellar masses could be captured by stars, start to swallow their material, and eventually turn them into BH, hence originating a peculiar new type of stellar catastrophic event. Here we revisit this process in the most favorable case of PBH capture by neutron stars. We detail a number of novel features in the capture phase, during the settling within the star and mass growth of the PBH, and illustrate some phenomenological consequences. In particular, we point out that in the subsonic regime the PBH drag takes the form of a Bondi accretion.

title: A systematic study on the rise time-peak luminosity relation for bright optical transients powered by wind shock breakout
authors: Akihiro Suzuki, Takashi J. Moriya, Tomoya Takiwaki
topic: A number of astrophyical transients originating from stellar explosions are powered by the collision of the ejected material with the circumstellar medium, which efficiently produces thermal radiation via shock dissipation. We investigate how such interaction-powered transients are distributed in the peak bolometric luminosity vs the rise time phase space. Taking the advantage of less time-consuming one-dimensional simulations with spherical symmetry, we calculated more than 500 models with different circumstellar mass and radius, ejecta mass and energy, and chemical compositions. The peak bolometric luminosity, the total radiated energy, and the rise time of the interaction-powered emission are measured for each simulated light curve. We consider how these characteristic quantities are determined as a function of the model parameters and discuss possible implications for the observed populations of (potential) interaction-powered transients, such as type IIn supernovae and fast blue optical transients.

topic: The observation of gravitational waves from an asymmetric binary opens the possibility for heavy neutron stars, but these pose challenges to models of the neutron star equation of state. We construct heavy neutron stars by introducing non-trivial structure in the speed of sound sourced by deconfined QCD matter, which cannot be well recovered by spectral representations. Their moment of inertia, Love number and quadrupole moment are very small, so a tenfold increase in sensitivity may be needed to test this possibility with gravitational waves, which is feasible with third generation detectors.

title: Fast Radio Burst Trains from Magnetar Oscillations
authors: Zorawar Wadiasingh, Cecilia Chirenti
topic: Quasi-periodic oscillations inferred during rare magnetar giant flare tails were initially interpreted as torsional oscillations of the neutron star (NS) crust, and have been more recently described as global core+crust perturbations. Similar frequencies are also present in high signal-to-noise magnetar short bursts. In magnetars, disturbances of the field are strongly coupled to the NS crust regardless of the triggering mechanism of short bursts.

authors: Maxim Lyutikov
topic: We discuss coherent free electron laser (FEL) operating during explosive reconnection events in magnetized pair plasma of magnetar magnetospheres. The model explains many salient features of Fast Radio Bursts/magnetars' radio emission: temporal coincidence of radio and high energy bursts, high efficiency of conversion of plasma kinetic energy into coherent radiation, presence of variable, narrow-band emission features drifting down in frequency, high degree of linear polarization.

title: Photospheric Emission in Gamma-ray Bursts: Variability
authors: Kai Wang, Da-Bin Lin, Yun Wang, Lu-yao Jiang, Shen-Shi Du, Xiao-Yan Li, Jia Ren, Xiang-gao Wang, En-Wei Liang
topic: It is generally believed that the variability of photospheric emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) traces that of the jet power. This work further investigates the variability of photospheric emission in a variable jet. By setting a constant η (dimensionless entropy of the jet), we find that the light curve of the photospheric emission shows a ``tracking'' pattern on the time profile of jet power. However, the relative variability is significantly low in the photospheric emission compared with that in the jet power. If the η is genetic variable, the variability of the photospheric emission is not only limited by the jet power but also affected by η strongly. It becomes complex and is generally different from that of the jet power. Moreover, the opposite phase may stand in the variabilities of the photospheric emission at different photon energies. We also find that the relative variability does not remain constant over the photon energies with an obvious reduction at a certain energy.

title: A rotation-driven pulsar radio emission mechanism]{A rotation-driven pulsar radio emission mechanism
authors: D. B. Melrose, M. Z. Rafat, A. Mastrano
topic: We propose and discuss an alternative pulsar radio emission mechanism that relies on rotation-driven plasma oscillations, rather than on a beam-driven instability, and suggest that it may be the generic radio emission mechanism for pulsars. We identify these oscillations as superluminal longitudinal waves in the pulsar plasma, and point out that these waves can escape directly in the O-mode. Escape of the energy in these oscillations is possible only if they are generated in overdense, field-aligned regions that we call fibers; the wave energy is initially refracted into underdense regions between the fibers, which act as ducts. Some implications of the model for the interpretation of pulsar radio emission are discussed.

We apply the jitter radiation to explain the GRB spectral diversities in the high-energy bands. In our model, the jitter radiative spectral index is determined by the spectral index of the turbulence.

authors: Fan Guo, Yi-Hsin Liu, Xiaocan Li, Hui Li, William Daughton, Patrick Kilian
topic: Magnetic reconnection in strongly magnetized astrophysical plasma environments is believed to be the primary process for fast energy release and particle energization. Currently there is strong interest in relativistic magnetic reconnection, in that it may provide a new explanation for high-energy particle acceleration and radiation in strongly magnetized astrophysical systems. We review recent advances in particle acceleration and reconnection physics in the magnetically-dominated regime. More discussion is focused on the physics of particle acceleration, power-law formation as well as the reconnection rate problem. In addition, we provide an outlook for studying reconnection acceleration mechanisms and kinetic physics in the next step.

title: CMacIonize 2.0: a novel task-based approach to Monte Carlo radiation transfer
authors: Bert Vandenbroucke, Peter Camps
topic: In this work, we present a novel approach to MCRT that addresses the challenging memory access patterns of traditional MCRT algorithms, which hinder optimal performance of MCRT simulations on modern hardware with a complex memory architecture. (Methods) We reformulate the MCRT photon packet life cycle as a task-based algorithm, whereby the computation is broken down into small tasks that are executed concurrently. Photon packets are stored in intermediate buffers, and tasks propagate photon packets through small parts of the computational domain, moving them from one buffer to another in the process. Using the implementation of the new algorithm in the photoionization MCRT code CMacIonize 2.0, we show that the decomposition of the MCRT grid into small parts leads to a significant performance gain during the photon packet propagation phase, which constitutes the bulk of an MCRT algorithm, as a result of better usage of memory caches.

title: On dynamics of nonmagnetic accretion disks
authors: V. S. Borisov
topic: Axisymmetric accretion disks in vicinity of a central compact body are studied. In the case of non-viscous disk it is proven that all solutions for the midplane circular velocity are unstable. Hence, the pure hydrodynamic turbulence in accretion disks is possible. It is disproved the well-known arguments that an inviscid accretion disk must be sub-Keplerian. It is also demonstrated that the regular asymptotic solutions, often used in astrophysics, can lead to erroneous conclusions. It is proven that a laminar viscous disk can be approximated with a great precision by the vortex motion. Assuming that a turbulent gas tends to flow with minimal losses, we have shown that a turbulent disk tends to be Keplerian.

authors: T. R. Routray, S. P. Pattnaik, C. Gonzalez-Boquera, X. Viñas, M. Centelles, B. Behera
topic: We perform a systematic study of the dependence of the r-mode phenomenology in normal fluid pulsar neutron stars on the symmetry energy slope parameter L. An essential ingredient in this study is the bulk viscosity, which is evaluated consistently for several equations of state corresponding to different values of the slope parameter L. Direct Urca processes, which are allowed from a critical L-value onwards, enhance the bulk viscosity and have large influence on the r-mode features, such as the instability boundary and spin-down properties of newborn neutron stars. The magnitude of the changes in the r-mode properties induced by the direct Urca processes are driven by the L-value of the equation of state and the mass of the pulsar.

topic: Ages and thermal luminosities of neutron stars, inferred from observations, can be interpreted with the aid of the neutron star cooling theory to gain information on the properties of superdense matter in neutron-star interiors. We present a survey of estimated ages, surface temperatures and thermal luminosities of middle-aged neutron stars with relatively weak or moderately strong magnetic fields, which can be useful for these purposes. The catalogue includes results selected from the literature, supplemented with new results of spectral analysis of a few cooling neutron stars. The data are compared with the theory. We show that overall agreement of theoretical cooling curves with observations improves substantially for models where neutron superfluidity in stellar core is weak.

title: Kink-driven magnetic reconnection in relativistic jets: consequences for X-ray polarimetry of BL Lacs
authors: Gianluigi Bodo, Fabrizo Tavecchio, Lorenzo Sironi
topic: We investigate with relativistic MHD simulations the dissipation physics of BL Lac jets, by studying the synchrotron polarization signatures of particles accelerated by the kink instability in a magnetically-dominated plasma column. The nonlinear stage of the kink instability generates current sheets, where particles can be efficiently accelerated via magnetic reconnection. We identify current sheets as regions where s = J d/B is above some predefined threshold (where B is the field strength, J the current density and d the grid scale), and assume that the particle injection efficiency scales as proportional to the square of the current. X-ray emitting particles have short cooling times, so they only probe the field geometry of their injection sites. In contrast, particles emitting in the optical band, which we follow self-consistently as they propagate away from their injection sites while cooling, sample a larger volume, and so they may be expected to produce different polarimetric signatures.

title: Parameter estimation for strong phase transitions in supranuclear matter using gravitational-wave astronomy
authors: Peter T. H. Pang, Tim Dietrich, Ingo Tews, Chris Van Den Broeck
topic: At supranuclear densities, explored in the core of neutron stars, a strong phase transition from hadronic matter to more exotic forms of matter might be present. To test this hypothesis, binary neutron-star mergers offer a unique possibility to probe matter at densities that we can not create in any existing terrestrial experiment. In this work, we show that, if present, strong phase transitions can have a measurable imprint on the binary neutron-star coalescence and the emitted gravitational-wave signal. We construct a new parameterization of the supranuclear equation of state that allows us to test for the existence of a strong phase transition and extract its characteristic properties purely from the gravitational-wave signal of the inspiraling neutron stars.

topic: While the primary was most likely a black hole, the secondary could be interpreted as either the lightest black hole or the most massive neutron star ever observed, but also as the indication of a novel class of exotic compact objects. We here argue that the secondary in GW190814 needs not be an ab-initio black hole nor an exotic object; rather, based on our current understanding of the nuclear-matter equation of state, it can be a rapidly rotating neutron star that collapsed to a rotating black hole at some point before merger.

topic: We scrutinize the paradigm that conventional long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the dominant source of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) within the internal shock scenario by describing UHECR spectrum and composition and by studying the predicted (source and cosmogenic) neutrino fluxes. Since it has been demonstrated that the stacking searches for astrophysical GRB neutrinos strongly constrain the parameter space in single-zone models, we focus on the dynamics of multiple collisions for which different messengers are expected to come from different regions of the same object. We propose a model which can describe both stochastic and deterministic engines, which we study in a systematic way.

title: Monte-Carlo simulations of fast Newtonian and mildly relativistic shock breakout from a stellar wind
authors: Hirotaka Ito, Amir Levinson, Ehud Nakar
topic: Strong explosion of a compact star surrounded by a thick stellar wind drives a fast (greater 0.1c) radiation mediated shock (RMS) that propagates in the wind, and ultimately breaks out gradually once photons start escaping from the shock transition layer. In exceptionally strong or aspherical explosions the shock velocity may even be relativistic. The properties of the breakout signal depend on the dynamics and structure of the shock during the breakout phase. Here we present, for the first time, spectra and lightcurves of the breakout emission of fast Newtonian and mildly relativistic shocks, that were calculated using self-consistent Monte-Carlo simulations of finite RMS with radiative losses.

title: Nuclear Reaction Screening, Weak Interactions, and r-Process Nucleosynthesis in High Magnetic Fields
authors: Michael Famiano, A. Baha Balantekin, Toshitaka Kajino, Motohiko Kusakabe, Kanji Mori, Yudong Luo
topic: Coulomb screening and weak interactions in a hot, magnetized plasma are investigated. Coulomb screening is evaluated in a relativistic thermal plasma in which electrons and positrons are in equilibrium. In addition to temperature effects, effects on weak screening from a strong external magnetic field are evaluated. In high fields, the electron transverse momentum components are quantized into Landau levels. The characteristic plasma screening length at high temperatures and at high magnetic fields is explored. In addition to changes to the screening length, changes in weak interaction rates are estimated. It is found that high fields can result in increased β-decay rates as the electron and positron spectra are dominated by Landau levels. Finally, the effects studied here are evaluated in a simple r-process model. It is found that relativistic Coulomb screening has a small effect on the final abundance distribution. While changes in weak interaction rates in strong magnetic fields can have an effect on the r-process evolution and abundance distribution, the field strength required to have a significant effect may be larger than what is currently thought to be typical of the r-process environment in collapsar jets or neutron star mergers.

authors: M. J. Graham, K. E. S. Ford, B. McKernan, N. P. Ross, D. Stern, K. Burdge, M. Coughlin, S. G. Djorgovski, A. J. Drake et al
topic: We report the first plausible optical electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to a (candidate) binary black hole (BBH) merger. Detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), the EM flare is consistent with expectations for a kicked BBH merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), and is unlikely due to intrinsic variability of this source. The lack of color evolution implies that it is not a supernovae and instead is strongly suggestive of a constant temperature shock. Other false-positive events, such as microlensing or a tidal disruption event, are ruled out or constrained.

topic: We report the discovery and panchromatic followup observations of the young Type Ic supernova, SN2020oi, in M100, a grand design spiral galaxy at a mere distance of 14 Mpc. We followed up with observations at radio, X-ray and optical wavelengths from only a few days to several months after explosion. The optical behaviour of the supernova is similar to those of other normal Type Ic supernovae. Given, the relatively small number of stripped envelope SNe for which radio emission is detectable, we used this opportunity to perform a detailed analysis of the comprehensive radio dataset we obtained. The radio emitting electrons initially experience a phase of inverse Compton cooling which leads to steepening of the spectral index of the radio emission.

topic: Cosmic strings and first-order phase transition are two main sources for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we study the stochastic gravitational wave radiation from cosmic string which is formed after the first-order phase transition. For the first-order phase transition occurs at temperature far beyond the electroweak scale, the gravitational wave signal cannot be reached by the future gravitational wave interferometers. The gravitational waves from cosmic strings that formed after the phase transition can be detected by future gravitational wave detectors in a wide range of frequency, and therefore its imprints can serve to search for firs-order phase transitions at high scales with the phase transition temperature:

title: Two-fluid simulations of the magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores in the weak-coupling regime
authors: F. Castillo, A. Reisenegger, J. A. Valdivia
topic: In a previous paper, we reported simulations of the evolution of the magnetic field in neutron star cores through ambipolar diffusion, taking the neutrons as a motionless uniform background. However, in real neutron stars, neutrons are free to move, and a strong composition gradient leads to stable stratification (stability against convective motions) both of which might impact on the time-scales of evolution. Here we address these issues by providing the first long-term two-fluid simulations of the evolution of an axially symmetric magnetic field in a neutron star core composed of neutrons, protons, and electrons with density and composition gradients. However, the evolution is found to be faster than in the case of motionless neutrons, as the movement of charged particles (which are coupled to the magnetic field, but are also limited by the collisional drag forces exerted by neutrons) is less constrained, since neutrons are now allowed to move. The possible impact of non-axisymmetric instabilities on these equilibria, as well as beta decays, proton superconductivity, and neutron superfluidity, are left for future work.

title: Hall cascade with fractional magnetic helicity in neutron star crusts
authors: Axel Brandenburg
topic: The ohmic decay of magnetic fields in the crusts of neutron stars is generally believed to be governed by Hall drift which leads to what is known as a Hall cascade. Here we show that helical and fractionally helical magnetic fields undergo strong inverse cascading like in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but the magnetic energy decays much more slowly Even for a nonhelical magnetic field there is inverse cascading with an increase of magnetic energy at the largest possible scale in the system. The strength of this effect depends on the strength of the magnetic field and disappears for weak fields.

topic: We report the observation of a compact binary coalescence involving a 22.2 - 24.3 Msun black hole and a compact object with a mass of 2.50 - 2.67 Msun (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run on August 14, 2019 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg2 at a distance of 241+41−45 Mpc; no electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves, 0.112+0.008−0.009, and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to less or eqyal 0.07. Tests of general relativity reveal no measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at high confidence.

topic: In the modern era of abundant X-ray detections and the increasing momentum of gravitational waves astronomy, tests of General Relativity in strong field regime become increasingly feasible and their importance for probing gravity cannot be understated. To this end, we study the characteristics of slowly rotating topological neutron stars in the tensor-multi-scalar theories of gravity following the static study of this new type of compact objects by two of the authors. We explore the moment of inertia and verify that universal relations known from General Relativity hold for this new class of compact objects. Furthermore, we study the properties of their innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and the epicyclic frequencies due to the latter's hinted link to observational quantities such as quasi-periodic X-ray spectrum features.

title: A Generalized Kompaneets Formalism for Inelastic Neutrino-Nucleon Scattering in Supernova Simulations
authors: Tianshu Wang, Adam Burrows
topic: Based on the Kompaneets approximation, we develop a robust methodology to calculate spectral redistribution via inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering in the context of core-collapse supernova simulations. The resulting equations conserve lepton number to machine precision and scale linearly, not quadratically, with number of energy groups. The formalism also provides an elegant means to derive the rate of energy transfer to matter which, as it must, automatically goes to zero when the neutrino radiation field is in thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we derive the next-higher-order in {\epsilon}/mc2 correction to the neutrino Kompaneets equation. Unlike other Kompaneets schema, ours also generalizes to the case of anisotropic angular distributions, while retaining the conservative form that is a hallmark of the classical Kompaneets equation. Our formalism enables immediate incorporation into supernova codes that follow the spectral angular moments of the neutrino radiation fields.

title: Testing the Weak Equivalence Principle and Lorentz Invariance with Multiwavelength Polarization Observations of GRB Optical Afterglows
authors: Jun-Jie Wei, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: Violations of both the weak equivalence principle (WEP) and Lorentz invariance can produce vacuum birefringence, which leads to an energy-dependent rotation of the polarization vector of linearly polarized emission from a given astrophysical source. However, the search for the birefringent effect has been hindered by our ignorance concerning the intrinsic polarization angle in different energy bands. Considering the contributions to the observed linear polarization angle from both the intrinsic polarization angle and the rotation angles induced by violations of the WEP and Lorentz invariance, and assuming the intrinsic polarization angle is an unknown constant, we simultaneously obtain robust bounds on possible deviations from the WEP and Lorentz invariance, by directly fitting the multiwavelength polarimetric data of the optical afterglows of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 020813 and GRB 021004.

topic: The wind driven by the intense neutrino emission from a protoneutron star (PNS) is an important site for producing nuclei heavier than the Fe group. Because of certain features in the neutrino angular distributions, the so-called fast flavor oscillations may occur very close to the PNS surface, effectively resetting the neutrino luminosities and energy spectra that drive the wind.
Using the unoscillated neutrino emission characteristics from two core-collapse supernova simulations representative of relevant progenitors at the lower and higher mass end, we study the potential effects of fast flavor oscillations on neutrino-driven winds and their nucleosynthesis.

title: Higher-order gravitational-wave modes will allow for percent-level measurements of Hubble's constant with single binary neutron star merger observations
authors: Juan Calderón Bustillo, Tim Dietrich, Paul D. Lasky
topic: The first multi-messenger gravitational-wave observation of a binary neutron star merger allowed for the first distance-ladder independent measure of Hubble's constant, albeit with an uncertainty of ∼15% at the 68\% credible level. We show that a single future observation of a binary neutron star merger with a network of detectors sensitive to the post-merger remnant at a few kHz, and commensurate improvement in cosmological redshift measurements, will allow for percent-level uncertainties in measurement of Hubble's constant. We show how higher-order modes can be exploited in astrophysical parameter estimation in both the inspiral phase, and also the post-merger remnant. While former suffices in the case of unequal-mass binaries to obtain major improvements in the distance estimates, the latter is crucial for equal-mass cases.

We demonstrate the influence of the fission fragment distributions for neutron-rich nuclei and discuss currently available treatments, including recent macroscopic-microscopic calculations. We conclude by comparing our nucleosynthesis results directly with stellar data for metal-poor stars rich in r-process elements to consider whether fission plays a role in the so-called `universality' of r-process abundances observed from star to star.

title: A brief overview of black hole-neutron star mergers
authors: Francois Foucart
topic: Of the three main types of binaries detectable through ground-based gravitational wave observations, black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers remain the most elusive. While candidates BHNS exist in the triggers released during the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO/Virgo collaboration, no detection has been confirmed so far. As for binary neutron star systems, BHNS binaries allow us to explore a wide range of physical processes, including the neutron star equation of state, nucleosynthesis, stellar evolution, high-energy astrophysics, and the expansion of the Universe. Here, we review some of the main features of BHNS systems: the distinction between disrupting and non-disrupting binaries, the types of outflows that BHNS mergers can produce, and the information that can be extracted from the observation of their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals. We also emphasize that for the most likely binary parameters, BHNS mergers seem less likely to power electromagnetic signals than binary neutron star systems. Finally, we discuss some of the issues that still limit our ability to model and interpret electromagnetic signals from BHNS binaries.

topic: The Fermi-LAT collaboration presented the second gamma-ray burst (GRB) catalog covering its first 10 years of operations. A significant fraction of afterglow-phase light curves in this catalog cannot be explained by the closure relations of the standard synchrotron forward-shock model, suggesting that there could be an important contribution from another process. In view of the above, we derive the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) light curves from the reverse shock in the thick- and thin-shell regime for a uniform-density medium. We show that this emission could explain the GeV flares exhibited in some LAT light curves. Additionally, we demonstrate that the passage of the forward shock synchrotron cooling break through the LAT band from jets expanding in a uniform-density environment may be responsible for the late time

The resulting equations have a rather simple form and can be readily applied, e.g., for studying magnetothermal evolution of neutron stars. We also establish a link between our formalism and the results known in the literature, and express the phenomenological diffusion coefficients through momentum transfer rates which are calculated from microscopic theory.

title: Constraining Magnetic Fields in the Circumgalactic Medium
authors: Ting-Wen Lan, J. Xavier Prochaska
topic: We study the properties of magnetic fields in the circumgalactic medium galaxies by correlating Faraday rotation measures of ∼1,000 high-redshift radio sources with the foreground galaxy number density estimated from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This method enables us to extract signals of rotation measures contributed by intervening gas around multiple galaxies. Our results show that there is no detectable correlation between the distribution of rotation measures and the number of foreground galaxies, contrary to several previous results. By adopting a column density distribution of ionized gas obtained from absorption line measurements, we further estimate the strengths of coherent magnetic fields parallel to the line of sight of less the equal 2 micro Gauss in the CGM.

title: General Relativistic Mean-field Dynamo Model for Proto-neutron Stars
authors: K. Franceschetti, L. Del Zanna
topic: Neutron stars, and magnetars in particular, are known to host the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. The origin of these strong fields is a matter of controversy. In this preliminary work, via numerical simulations, we study, for the first time in non-ideal general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) regime, the growth of the magnetic field due to the action of the mean-field dynamo due to sub-scale, unresolved turbulence. The dynamo process, combined with the differential rotation of the (proto-)star, is able to produce an exponential growth of any initial magnetic seed field up to the values required to explain the observations. By varying the dynamo coefficient we obtain different growth rates. We find a quasi-linear dependence of the growth rates on the intensity of the dynamo. Furthermore, the time interval in which exponential growth occurs and the growth rates also seems to depend on the initial configuration of the magnetic field.

title: Deciphering the properties of the central engine in GRB collapsars
authors: M. Petropoulou, P. Beniamini, G. Vasilopoulos, D. Giannios, R. Barniol Duran
topic: The central engine in long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is thought to be a compact object produced by the core collapse of massive stars, but its exact nature (black hole or millisecond magnetar) is still debatable. Although the central engine of GRB collapsars is hidden to direct observation, its properties may be imprinted on the accompanying electromagnetic signals. We aim to decipher the generic properties of central engines that are consistent with prompt observations of long GRBs detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Adopting a generic model for the central engine, in which the engine power and activity timescale are independent of each other, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of long GRBs produced by jets that successfully breakout from the star. The intrinsic 2D distribution of simulated collapsar GRBs peaks at lower gamma-ray luminosities and longer durations than the observed one, a prediction that can be tested in the future with more sensitive detectors. Black-hole accretors, whose power and activity time are set by the large-scale magnetic flux through the progenitor star and stellar structure, respectively, are compatible with the properties of the central engine inferred by our model.

title: Accretion-to-jet energy conversion efficiency in GW170817
authors: Om S. Salafia, Bruno Giacomazzo
topic: Based on previously published multi-wavelength modelling of the GRB 170817A jet afterglow, that includes information from the VLBI centroid motion, we construct the posterior probability density distribution on the total energy in the bipolar jets launched by the GW170817 merger remnant. By applying a new numerical-relativity-informed fitting formula for the accretion disk mass, we construct the posterior probability density distribution of the GW170817 remnant disk mass. By combining the two, we estimate the accretion-to-jet energy conversion efficiency in this system, carefully accounting for uncertainties.  Such an efficiency also agrees with that anticipated for the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, provided that the magnetic field in the disk right after the merger is predominantly toroidal (which is expected as a result of the merger dynamics).

title: Bulk Viscous Damping of Density Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Mark Alford, Arus Harutyunyan, Armen Sedrakian
topic: We discuss the damping of density oscillations in dense nuclear matter in the temperature range relevant to neutron star mergers. This damping is due to bulk viscosity arising from the weak interaction ``Urca'' processes of neutron decay and electron capture. The nuclear matter is modelled in the relativistic density functional approach. The bulk viscosity reaches a resonant maximum close to the neutrino trapping temperature, then drops rapidly as temperature rises into the range where neutrinos are trapped in neutron stars. We investigate the bulk viscous dissipation timescales in a post-merger object and identify regimes where these timescales are as short as the characteristic timescale 10 ms, and, therefore, might affect the evolution of the post-merger object. Our analysis indicates that bulk viscous damping would be important at not too high temperatures of the order of a few MeV and densities up to a few times saturation density.

authors: V. A. Acciari, S. Ansoldi, L. A. Antonelli, A. Arbet Engels, D. Baack, A. Babić, B. Banerjee, U. Barres de Almeida, J. A. Barrio et al
topic: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from ultra-relativistic jets launched from the collapsing cores of dying massive stars. They are characterised by an initial phase of bright and highly variable radiation in the keV-MeV band that is likely produced within the jet and lasts from milliseconds to minutes, known as the prompt emission. Subsequently, the interaction of the jet with the external medium generates external shock waves, responsible for the afterglow emission, which lasts from days to months, and occurs over a broad energy range, from the radio to the GeV bands. The afterglow emission is generally well explained as synchrotron radiation by electrons accelerated at the external shock. We find that the broadband spectral energy distribution is double-peaked, with the TeV emission constituting a distinct spectral component that has power comparable to the synchrotron component.

authors: MAGIC Collaboration: V. A. Acciari, S. Ansoldi, L. A. Antonelli, A. Arbet Engels, D. Baack, A. Babić, B. Banerjee, U. Barres de Almeida et al
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) of the long-duration class are the most luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation known in the Universe. They are generated by outflows of plasma ejected at near the speed of light by newly formed neutron stars or black holes of stellar mass at cosmological distances. Prompt flashes of MeV gamma rays are followed by longer-lasting afterglow emission from radio waves to GeV gamma rays, due to synchrotron radiation by energetic electrons in accompanying shock waves. Although emission of gamma rays at even higher, TeV energies by other radiation mechanisms had been theoretically predicted, it had never been detected previously. Here we report the clear detection of GRB 190114C in the TeV band, achieved after many years of dedicated searches for TeV emission from GRBs The observed similarity in the radiated power and temporal behaviour of the TeV and X-ray bands points to processes such as inverse Compton radiation as the mechanism of the TeV emission, while processes such as synchrotron emission by ultrahigh-energy protons are disfavoured due to their low radiative efficiency.

title: Radio Emission from Ultra-stripped Supernovae as Diagnostics for Properties of the Remnant Double Neutron Star Binaries
authors: Tomoki Matsuoka, Keiichi Maeda
topic: An ultra-stripped supernova (SN) is an explosion of a helium or C+O star whose outer envelope has been stripped away by a companion neutron star. A double neutron star (DNS) binary is believed to be left after the explosion, which will emit the gravitational wave later at the coalescence. Recent detections of a few candidates for the ultra-stripped SN have constrained the properties of the explosion and the progenitor, but little information is given as to whether the remnant DNS binary will merge within the cosmic age. A large fraction of the material stripped away from the helium star through the binary interaction is expected to escape from the system and form circumstellar material (CSM). The CSM should be traced by radio emission induced by the collision with the SN ejecta. Based on the stellar evolution models previously developed, we calculate the expected radio luminosities from ultra-stripped SNe. We find that high radio luminosity at its maximum can be an indicator of small separation of a DNS binary leading to its merger within the cosmic age. Our results can be used to optimize the strategy for the radio follow-up observations such as observational epochs and frequencies.

title: Neutron star inner crust: effects of rotation and magnetic fields
authors: Ivo Sengo, Helena Pais, Bruno Franzon, Constança Providência
topic: We study the role of the pasta phases on the properties of rotating and magnetized neutron stars. In order to investigate such systems, we make use of two different relativistic mean-field unified inner-crust--core equations of state, with a different density dependence of the symmetry energy, and an inner-crust computed within a Thomas-Fermi calculation. Special attention is given to the crust-core transition density, and the pasta phases effects on the global properties of stars. The effects of strong magnetic fields and fast rotation are computed by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations self-consistently, taking into account anisotropies induced by the centrifugal and the Lorentz force. The location of the magnetic field neutral line and the maximum of the Lorentz force on the equatorial plane are calculated. The conditions under which they fall inside the inner crust region are discussed. We verified that models with a larger symmetry energy slope show more sensitivity to the variation of the magnetic field.

authors: A. K. H. Kong, K. L. Li, S. Kim, C. Y. Hui
topic: The recent discovery of a millisecond radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has initiated an intense discussion about the connection between magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Although some properties of the radio burst from SGR 1935+2154 are not the same as cosmological FRBs, there are theoretical models which propose a connection between magnetars and FRBs (see review by Margalit et al. 2020). In particular, the role of a magnetar wind nebula is included in some models, and therefore it is worthwhile to investigate the X-ray environment of SGR 1935+2154 in more detail. Here, we report on the discovery of an X-ray transient feature near SGR 1935+2154 using archival Chandra data and discuss its possible origin.

title: Reverse Shocks in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts -- The case of GRB 160821B and prospects as gravitational-wave counterparts
authors: Gavin P Lamb
topic: The shock system that produces the afterglow to GRBs consists of a forward- and a reverse-shock. For short GRBs, observational evidence for a reverse-shock has been sparse, however, the afterglow to GRB 160821B requires a reverse-shock at early times to explain the radio observations. GRB 160821B is additionally accompanied by the best-sampled macronova without a gravitational-wave detection, and an interesting late-time X-ray afterglow behaviour indicative of a refreshed-shock. The presence of an observed reverse-shock in an on-axis short GRB means that the reverse-shock should be considered as a potential counterpart to gravitational-wave detected mergers. As a gravitational-wave counterpart, the afterglow to an off-axis GRB jet can reveal the jet structure -- a reverse-shock will exist in these structured jet systems and the signature of these reverse-shocks, if observed, can indicate the degree of magnetisation in the outflow. Here we show the case of GRB 160821B, and how a reverse-shock will appear for an off-axis observer to a structured jet.

topic: Meteoritic analysis demonstrates that radioactive nuclei heavier than iron were present in the early Solar System. Among them, 129I and 247Cm both have a rapid neutron-capture process (r process) origin and decay on the same timescale (approx 15.6 Myr). We show that the 129I/247Cm abundance ratio in the early Solar System (433 plus minus 184) is immune to galactic evolution uncertainties and represents the first direct observational constraint for the properties of the last r-process event that polluted the pre-solar nebula. We investigate the physical conditions of this event using nucleosynthesis calculations and demonstrate that moderately neutron-rich ejecta can produce the observed ratio. We conclude that a dominant contribution by exceedingly neutron-rich ejecta is highly disfavoured.

topic: Recent observations with the Chandra X-ray telescope continue to detect X-ray emission from the transient GW170817. The current dataset appears consistent both with energy injection by a long-lived central engine and with the onset of a kilonova afterglow, arising from the interaction of the sub-relativistic merger ejecta with the surrounding medium. Long-term monitoring of this source will be essential to test these different models.

title: The jet structure and the intrinsic luminosity function of short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Wei-Wei Tan, Yun-Wei Yu
topic: The joint observation of GW170817 and GRB 170817A indicated that short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) can originate from binary neutron star mergers. Moreover, some SGRBs could be detected off-axis, while the SGRB jets are highly structured. Then, by assuming an universal angular distribution of the jet emission for all SGRBs For self-consistency, this angular distribution is simultaneously constrained by the luminosity and event rate of GRB 170817A. Meanwhile, the intrinsic luminosity function (LF) of the on-axis emission of the jets can be simply described by a single power law with a low-luminosity exponential cutoff. The usually discovered broken-power-law apparent LF for relatively high luminosities can naturally result from the coupling of the intrinsic LF with the angular distribution of the jet emission, as the viewing angles to the SGRBs are arbitrarily distributed.

By compiling all archival data, and reprocessing a subset of it, we have ensured that the panchromatic dataset is uniform and therefore immune to the differences in data processing or flux determination methods used by different groups. Our fits to the afterglow data using an analytical model that includes VLBI proper motion from Mooley et al (2018), and a structured jet model that ignores the proper motion, indicates that the proper motion measurement needs to be considered while seeking an accurate estimate of the viewing angle.

title: The structure of hydrodynamic γ-ray burst jets
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Ehud Nakar, Omer Bromberg
topic: Here, using a set of 3D simulations we follow the evolution of hydrodynamic long and short GRB jets after breakout and provide a physically motivated post-breakout outflow structure of GRB jets (the structure of weakly magnetized jets is underway). Our simulations feature Rayleigh-Taylor fingers, which grow from the cocoon into the jet and destabilize it. The mixing of jet-cocoon material gives rise to a previously unidentified region between the two, which we denote the jet-cocoon interface (JCI). In lGRBs the mixing is strong, leading to most of the outflow energy to drift into the JCI. In sGRBs, where the medium is lighter, the mixing is weaker, and the JCI and the jet core hold a comparable amount of energy. At larger angles, where the cocoon dominates, the structure is more complex including both an angular and a radial structure. The mixing shapes the prompt light curve and implies that typical afterglows of lGRBs are different from those of sGRBs. The predictions that we provide can be used to infer jet characteristics from prompt and afterglow observations.

title: The Luminosity Distribution of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts under a Structured Jet Scenario
authors: Qi Guo, Daming Wei, Yuanzhu Wang
topic:  In this paper, we calculate the luminosity distribution of sGRBs and its evolution with redshift based on the structured (Gaussian) jet model, and find that the typical luminosity increase with redshift, for nearby sGRBs (such as for luminosity distance less than 200 Mpc) the typical gamma-ray luminosity is just around  which naturally explains the very low radiation luminosity of GRB 170817A. We derived the detection probability of sGRBs by Fermi-GBM and found that the expected detection rate of sGRBs is only about 1 yr-1 within the distance of several hundred Mpc. Finally, we compare our results of gamma-ray luminosity distribution with sGRBs with known redshifts, and found that our results are consistent with the observation, which implies that our simulation results can reproduce the observed luminosity distribution well.

title: Variability in Short Gamma-ray Bursts: Gravitationally Unstable Tidal Tails
authors: Eric R. Coughlin, C. J. Nixon, Jennifer Barnes, Brian D. Metzger, R. Margutti
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts are thought to result from the mergers of two neutron stars or a neutron star and stellar mass black hole. The final stages of the merger are generally accompanied by the production of one or more tidal "tails" of ejecta, which fall back onto the remnant-disc system at late times. Using the results of a linear stability analysis, we show that if the material comprising these tails is modeled as adiabatic and the effective adiabatic index satisfies γ≥5/3, then the tails are gravitationally unstable and collapse to form small-scale knots. We analytically estimate the properties of these knots, including their spacing along the tidal tail and the total number produced, and their effect on the mass return rate to the merger remnant. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of the disruption of a polytropic (with the polytropic and adiabatic indices γ equal), γ=2 neutron star by a black hole, and find agreement between the predictions of the linear stability analysis and the distribution of knots that collapse out of the instability.

title: Pair separation in parallel electric field of a magnetar magnetosphere and narrow spectra of fast radio bursts
authors: Yuan-Pei Yang, Jin-Ping Zhu, Bing Zhang, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: When a magnetar magnetosphere is trigged by crustal deformations, an electric field E|| parallel to the magnetic field line would appear via Alvfén waves in the charge starvation region. If electron-positron pair bunches pre-exist, e.g., via some possible plasma instabilities, in the magnetosphere, these pairs will undergo charge separation in the E|| and in the meantime emit coherent curvature radiation. Following the approach of Yang & Zhang (2018), we find that the superposed curvature radiation becomes narrower due to charge separation, with the width of spectrum depending on the separation between the electron and positron clumps. This mechanism can interpret the narrow spectra of FRBs, in particular, the Galactic FRB 200428 recently detected in association with a hard X-ray burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154.

title: Analytical Solutions of Radiative Transfer Equations in Accretion Discs with Finite Optical Depth
authors: Maryam Samadi, Fahimeh Habibi, Shahram Abbassi
topic: The main purpose of this paper is to obtain analytical solutions for radiative transfer equations related to the vertical structure of accretion discs with finite optical depth. In the non-gray atmosphere, we employ the optical-depth dependent Eddington factor to define the relationship between the mean intensity and radiation stress tensor. Analytical solutions are achieved for two cases: (i) radiative equilibrium, and (ii) a disc with uniform internal heating and both cases are assumed to be in local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE), too. Our results show that for the first case, the surface value of mean intensity with constant Eddington factor is three times larger than that with a variable factor. Moreover, scattering has no role in the vertical radiative structure of discs with the assumptions of the first case. On the other hand, for the second case, we encounter reductions in all radiative quantities as the photon destruction probability decreases (which is equivalent to increasing scattering).

Accordingly, pulsars are born with embryonic incompressible superconducting gluon-quark superfluid cores (SuSu-matter) that are embedded in Minkowski spacetime, whereas the ambient compressible and dissipative media (CDM) are imbedded in curved spacetime. As pulsars cool down, the equilibrium between both spacetime is altered, thereby triggering the well-observed glitch phenomena.

topic: Detection and parameter estimation of binary neutron star merger remnants can shed light on the physics of hot matter at supranuclear densities. Here we develop a fast, simple model that can generate gravitational waveforms, and show it can be used for both detection and parameter estimation of post-merger remnants. The model consists of three exponentially-damped sinusoids with a linear frequency-drift term. The median fitting factors between the model waveforms and numerical-relativity simulations exceed 0.90. We detect remnants at a post-merger signal-to-noise ratio of \geq 7 using a Bayes-factor detection statistic with a threshold of 3000.

authors: Immanuel Christopher Jebaraj, Jasmina Magdalenic, Tatiana Podladchikova, Camilla Scolini, Jens Pomoell, Astrid Veronig, Karin Dissauer, Vratislav Krupar, Emilia Kilpua, Stefaan Poedts
topic: Context: Eruptive events such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares accelerate particles and generate shock waves which can arrive at Earth and can disturb the magnetosphere. Understanding the association between CMEs and CME-driven shocks is therefore highly important for space weather studies. Aims: We present a study of the CME/flare event associated with two type II bursts observed on September 27, 2012. The aim of the study is to understand the relationship between the observed CME and the two distinct shock wave signatures. Methods: The multi-wavelength study of the eruptive event (CME/flare) was complemented with radio triangulation of the associated radio emission and modelling of the CME and the shock wave employing MHD simulations. Results: We found that, although temporal association between the type II bursts and the CME is good, the low-frequency type II(LF-type II) burst occurs significantly higher in the corona than the CME and its relationship to the CME is not straightforward.

The extent to which spallation modifies the final NSM isotopic yields depends on: the ejected abundances, which are determined by the NSM astrophysical conditions and the properties of nuclei far from stability, the ejecta velocity distribution and propagation in interstellar matter, and the spallation cross-sections. Observed solar and stellar r-process yields could thus constrain the velocity distribution of ejected neutron star matter, assuming NSMs are the dominant r-process source

title: Towards a paradigm change in the main heavy r-process nucleosynthesis sites
authors: Aldana Grichener, Noam Soker 
topic: We study the basic properties of three possible r-process scenarios (sites) and compare them to recent observations and theoretical simulations. We find that the common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can account for the different observations of r-process nucleosynthesis, including the presence of r-process-rich low-metalicity stars in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The neutron star (NS)-NS merger scenario and the collapsar scenario encounter some difficulties. Despite that, we conclude that it is very likely that more than one r-process scenario exists, with a significant contribution by the CEJSN r-process scenario. We give a prescription to include this scenario in population synthesis studies of the r-process.

We develop a phase-agnostic likelihood model that uses only the spectral content for parameter estimation and demonstrate the calculation of a Bayesian upper limit in the absence of a signal.

authors: Tim Dietrich, Katy Clough
topic: we perform numerical relativity simulations of a binary neutron star merger, including a phenomenological description of the nucleon-nucleon-axion bremsstrahlung to quantify the effects of such a cooling channel on the dynamical evolution. While our simulations show a difference in the temperature profile of the merger remnant, the imprint of the axion via nucleon-nucleon-axion bremsstrahlung on the emitted gravitational wave signal and the ejecta mass is too small to improve constraints on the axion mass with current or future planned detectors. Whilst we consider a limited number of cases, and a simplified cooling model, these broadly represent the "best case" scenario, thus, a more thorough investigation is unlikely to change the conclusions, at least for this particular interaction channel.

title: Diversity of kilonova light curves
authors: Kyohei Kawaguchi, Masaru Shibata, Masaomi Tanaka
topic: We perform radiative transfer simulations for kilonova in various situations, including the cases of prompt collapse to a black hole from neutron-star mergers, high-velocity ejecta possibly accelerated by magnetars, and a black hole-neutron star merger. Our calculations are done employing ejecta profiles predicted by numerical-relativity simulations and a new line list for all the r-process elements.
is indicates that we may be able to infer the type of the central engine for kilonovae by observation of the peak in the multiple band.

title: Using failed supernovae to constrain the Galactic r-process element production
authors: B. Wehmeyer, C. Frohlich, B. Côté, M. Pignatari, F.-K. Thielemann
topic: The large scatter of r-process elements in the early Galaxy suggests that the r-process is made by rare events, like compact binary mergers and rare sub-classes of supernovae. Although being rare, neutron star mergers alone have difficulties to explain the observed enhancement of r-process elements in the lowest metallicity stars compared to Fe. In this work we investigate another complementary scenario, where the r-process occurs in neutron star-black hole mergers in addition to neutron star mergers. Neutron star-black hole mergers would eject similar amounts of r-process matter as neutron star mergers, but only the neutron star progenitor would have produced Fe.

The combination of dilution and small number statistics produces a large scatter in the expected r-process enrichment within a single UFD or classical dwarf galaxy. Comparison between our results and observed europium abundances reveals a tension that even a systematic choice of optimistic parameters in our models cannot release. Such a discrepancy could point to the need of additional r-process production sites that suffer less severe dilution or to a population of extremely fast merging binaries.

We show that the small but non-negligible optical depths lead to neutrino transport globally coupling the disk electron fraction, which we capture by solving the transport equation with a Monte Carlo method. The resulting absorption drives up the electron fraction in a structured, continuous outflow, with electron fraction as high as Ye∼0.4 in the extreme polar region. We show via nuclear reaction network and radiative transfer calculations that nucleosynthesis in the disk wind will produce a blue kilonova.

topic: We systematically investigate the outflow structure of GW170817 in comparison with a sample of 27 cosmological short GRBs by modelling their afterglow light curves. We find that cosmological short GRBs share the same outflow structures with GW170817, relativistic structured jets. The similarity between the GW170817 outflow structure and those of cosmological short GRBs indicates that cosmological short GRBs are likely neutron star mergers.

title: Constraining coherent low frequency radio flares from compact binary mergers
authors: A. Rowlinson, G.E. Anderson
topic: For this paper, we constrain this coherent radio emission using the deepest available constraints for GRB 150424A, which were obtained via a triggered observation with the Murchison Widefield Array. We then expand this analysis to determine the properties of magnetar merger remnants that may be formed via a general population of binary neutron star mergers. Our results demonstrate that many of the potential coherent emission mechanisms that have been proposed for such events can be detected or very tightly constrained by the complementary strategies used by the current generation of low-frequency radio telescopes

title: The lanthanide fraction distribution in metal-poor stars: a test of neutron star mergers as the dominant r-process site
authors: Alexander P. Ji, Maria R. Drout, Terese T. Hansen
topic: The lanthanide fraction (XLa) is a measurable quantity in both kilonovae and metal-poor stars, but it has not previously been explicitly calculated for stars. Here, we compute the lanthanide fraction distribution of metal-poor stars to enable comparison to current and future kilonovae. For neutron star mergers to remain viable as the dominant r-process site, future kilonova observations should be preferentially lanthanide-rich. These high-XLa kilonovae may be fainter and more rapidly evolving than GW170817, posing a challenge for discovery and follow-up observations

topic: Here, we explore the latter by performing a GRMHD BNS merger simulation extending up to \sim 100 ms after merger, much longer than any previous simulation of this kind. This allows us to (i) study the emerging structure and amplification of the magnetic field and observe a clear saturation at magnetic energy 10^51. We follow the magnetically supported expansion of the outer layers of the remnant NS and its evolution into an ellipsoidal shape without any surrounding torus. We also argue that the conditions at the end of the simulation disfavor later jet formation on subsecond timescales if no BH is formed.

title: Structured Jets and X-ray Plateaus in Gamma-Ray Burst Phenomena
authors: Gor Oganesyan, Stefano Ascenzi, Marica Branchesi, Om Sharan Salafia, Simone Dall'Osso, Giancarlo Ghirlanda
topic: Here we show that the high-latitude emission from a structured jet can naturally produce an X-ray plateau in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves, independent of the radiation from an external shock. We calculate the radiation from a switched-off shell featuring an angular structure in both its relativistic bulk motion and intrinsic brightness. Our model is able to explain the shallow decay phase (plateau) often observed in GRB X-ray light curves. We discuss the possible contribution of the structured jet high-latitude emission to other distinctive features of GRB X-ray light curves, and its capability to explain the chromatic optical/X-ray light curve properties.

topic: Here we investigate the use of fine-structure, line-binned opacities that preserve the integral of the opacity over frequency. Advantages of this area-preserving approach over the traditional expansion-opacity formalism include the ability to pre-calculate opacity tables that are independent of the type of hydrodynamic expansion and that eliminate the computational expense of calculating opacities within radiation-transport simulations. Tabular opacities are generated for all 14 lanthanides as well as a representative actinide element, uranium. We demonstrate that spectral simulations produced with the line-binned opacities agree well with results produced with the more accurate continuous Monte Carlo Sobolev approach, as well as with the commonly used expansion-opacity formalism

authors: N. Fraija, D. Lopez-Camara, A.C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, P. Veres, S. Dichiara
topic: We calculate the light curves obtained from an analytic model in which the synchrotron and SSC emission (in the fast- or slow-cooling regime) of an off-axis top-hat jet and a quasi-spherical outflow are decelerated in either a homogeneous or a wind-like circumburst medium. We show that the synchrotron emission of the quasi-spherical outflow is stronger than that of the off-axis jet during the first \sim 10 - 20 days, and weaker during the next \geq 80 days. For GRB 170817A, we find using our model that the synchrotron emission generated by the quasi-spherical outflow and off-axis top-hat jet increase.

We simulate radiative transfer in the ejecta in either 1D spherical or 2D cylindrical spatial geometry. Our models that fit the bolometric luminosity of AT 2017gfo (the kilonova associated with the first neutron star merger discovered in gravitational waves, GW170817) do not simultaneously fit the B, V, and I time evolution. However, we find that the trends of the evolution in B and V magnitudes are better matched by the fallback model relative to the pulsar model, implying the time dependence of the remnant source influences the color evolution.

To parameterize the nuclear EoS, we use a different approach, expanding from pure nuclear matter rather than from symmetric nuclear matter to make use of recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations.

In this case, in fact, the merger remnant has an excess angular momentum yielding a more extended and "colder" object, with reduced ability to shed mass dynamically.

Abundance patterns and rates of nuclear energy production. We show that the accumulation of fissioning material during the r process can strongly affect the free neutron abundance after the r-process freeze-out. This leads to a significant impact on the abundances of heavy nuclei that undergo α decay or spontaneous fission, affecting the radioactive energy production by the ejecta at timescales relevant for kilonova emission.

topic:  In this study, we introduce and apply the "Actinide-Dilution with Matching" model to a variety of stellar groups ranging from actinide-deficient to actinide-enhanced to empirically characterize r-process ejecta mass as a function of electron fraction. The very low-Ye, fission-cycling ejecta of an r-process event need only constitute 10-30% of the total ejecta mass to accommodate most actinide abundances of metal-poor stars. We find that our empirical Ye distributions of ejecta are similar to those inferred from studies of GW170817 mass ejecta ratios, which is consistent with neutron-star mergers being a source of the heavy elements in metal-poor, r-process enhanced stars.

topic: Here, we perform a set of simulations of low-mass NSBH mergers, including systems compatible with GW170817. Our simulations use a composition and temperature dependent equation of state (DD2) and approximate neutrino transport, but no magnetic fields. We find that low-mass NSBH mergers produce remnant disks significantly less massive than previously expected, and consistent with the post-merger outflow mass inferred from GW170817 for moderately asymmetric mass ratio. The dynamical ejecta produced by systems compatible with GW170817 is negligible except if the mass ratio and black hole spin are at the edge of the allowed parameter space. That dynamical ejecta is cold, neutron-rich, and surprisingly slow for ejecta produced during the tidal disruption of a neutron star.

topic: Although high-energy neutrinos were not detected from this event, mergers of neutron stars are expected to produce such high-energy particles. Relativistic jets are launched when neutron stars merge. If the jets contain protons, they can emit high-energy neutrinos through photomeson production. In addition, neutron star mergers produce massive and fast ejecta, which can be a source of Galactic high-energy cosmic rays above the knee.

title: The mass distribution of Galactic double neutron stars
authors: Nicholas Farrow, Xing-Jiang Zhu, Eric Thrane
topic: we perform Bayesian inference using a sample of 17 Galactic double neutron stars effectively doubling the sample used in previous studies. We show that precise component mass measurements of ≈20 double neutron stars are required in order to determine with high confidence (a Bayes factor of 150) if recycled and non-recycled neutron stars come from a common distribution. Approximately 60 are needed in order to establish the detailed shape of the distributions.

authors: Nicole M. Lloyd-Ronning, Chris Fryer, Jonah Miller, Neelima Prasad, Chris Torres, Phillip Martin
topic: Under the assumption that a Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) is ultimately produced by a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet from a highly spinning black hole BH, we put limits on the magnetic field and BH mass needed to power observed long and short GRBs. For BHs in the range. We also discuss the implications and consequences of high magnetic fields in GRB BH-disk systems, in terms of MRI field growth and magnetically arrested disks. Finally, we examine the conditions under which the progenitor systems can retain enough angular momentum to create BHs spinning rapidly enough to power BZ jets.

authors: Fabrícia A. C. Pereira, Giuseppe Lodato, Irapuan Rodrigues, Márcio E. S. Alves, Daniel J. Price
topic: We estimate the accretion rates produced when a circumprimary gas disc is pushed into the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH) by the tidal force of the decaying secondary during a SMBH merger. Using the 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We find that discs with small inclination angles (\leq 10 degrees) produce an increase in luminosity exceeding the Eddington rate. we show that the misaligned snowplough effect remains important even for angles larger than the disc aspect ratio. The rise in the accretion rate produced by discs inclined at small angles to the binary orbit can produce an electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational wave signal emitted from final stages of the binary orbital decay.

title: Bayesian Analysis on the X-ray Spectra of the Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817
authors: En-Tzu Lin, Hoi-Fung Yu, Albert K.H. Kong
topic: For the first time, we present a Bayesian time-resolved spectral study of the X-ray afterglow datasets of GW170817/GRB17017A observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  While our results are consistent with the other works using Cash statistic within uncertainty, the Bayesian analysis we performed in this work have yielded Gaussian-like parameter distributions. We also obtained the parameter uncertainties directly from their posterior probability distributions. The X-ray flux has been fading since \sim160 days after the merger and has returned to the level as first discovered after one year. Our result shows that the X-ray spectrum of GW170817/GRB170817A is well-described by a simple power-law originated from non-thermal slow-cooling synchrotron radiation.

title: Discrete and Continuous Ejection Models of the Radio Source Associated with GW170817

topic: the discrete region includes all of the radio flux, and there is likely a synchrotron self absorption (SSA) spectral turnover. The velocity can constrain the kinematics and the SSA turnover has been used to constrain the size to much smaller than can be done with an unresolved VLBI image, allowing one to estimate the associated plasmoid size directly from the data and improve estimates of the energetics. Models of the radio emission for both a turbulent, protonic, discrete ballistic ejection and a high dissipation region within an otherwise invisible Poynting flux dominated positron-electron jet are considered. Even though only valid after day 110, this independent analysis augments traditional GRB light curve studies, providing additional constraints on the merger event.

We also show that these equations can be written as a first-order symmetric hyperbolic system, implying local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the equations of motion. We use an arbitrary equation of state and do not make any simplifying symmetry or near-equilibrium assumption, requiring only physically natural conditions on the fields. These results pave the way for the inclusion of bulk viscosity effects in simulations of gravitational-wave signals coming from neutron star mergers.

authors: Kai-Kai Duan, Zhi-Ping Jin, Fu-Wen Zhang, Yi-Ming Zhu, Xiang Li, Yi-Zhong Fan, Da-Ming Wei
topic:  the afterglow emission of the bright sGRBs and GW170817/GRB 170817A form a natural and continuous sequence, though separated by an observation time gap. If viewed on-axis, the forward shock afterglow emission of GW170817/GRB 170817A would be among the brightest ones detected so far. This provides a strong evidence for the GW170817-like merger origin of bright sGRBs, and suggests that the detection of the forward shock afterglow emission of most neutron star merger events are more challenging than the case of GW170817 since usually the mergers will be more distant and the viewing angles are plausibly higher.

authors: Andrei M. Beloborodov, Christoffer Lundman, Yuri Levin
topic: We suggest that neutron star mergers eject an ultra-relativistic envelope of mass 1e10-7 Msun, which helps explain the gamma-ray burst from GW170817. One ejection mechanism is the ablation of the neutron star surface by the burst of neutrinos in the first 30 microsec.  Another, more efficient, mechanism for inflating the ultra-relativistic envelope is an internal shock in the massive ejecta from the merger. A strong shock is expected if the merger product is a magnetar, which emits a centrifugally accelerated wind.

topic: However, these models generate local cosmic NS-NS merger rate in old host galaxies that are below the LIGO/Virgo estimate. The reason behind this tension is the predicted delay time distribution between star formation and NS-NS mergers that favors short delays. However, we show that such distribution is consistent with observations of Galactic NS-NS binaries; 50% of which show very long merger times (much longer than Hubble time). Once model distributions are convolved with continuous prolonged (10 Gyr) star formation in the Galactic disk, then 20-70% (depending on a model) of the predicted NS-NS population has very long current Galactic merger times

authors: Dhruv Desai, Brian D. Metzger, Francois Foucart
topic: One source of late-time engine activity is fall-back accretion of bound tidal ejecta. Here, we re-examine the impact of heating due to rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis on rate of the fall-back accretion, using ejecta properties obtained from numerical relativity simulations of NS-BH mergers in a toy model for the dynamical influence of nuclear heating. Depending on the mass of the remnant black hole, r-process heating can imprint a variety of fall-back curve shapes, ranging from temporal lulls of up to tens of seconds to complete late-time cut-off in the fall-back rate. This behavior is robust to realistic variations in the nuclear heating experienced by different parts of the ejecta.

In particular, we investigate the effect of the kick velocities that neutron star binaries receive upon their formation, in the building block galaxies (BBs) that partly formed the stellar halo by merging with our Galaxy.  We conclude that our assumption of instantaneous mixing is most likely inaccurate for modelling the r-process enrichment of the Galactic halo, or an additional production site for r-process elements is necessary to explain the presence of low-metallicity halo stars with high Eu abundances.

title: Cooling off with a kilonova - Lower Limit on the Expansion Velocity of GW170817
authors: Itai Linial, Re'em Sari
topic:  At early times, when the kilonova is still dominant, the synchrotron emitting electrons can efficiently cool by up-scattering the kilonova photos through inverse-Compton. Yet, the cooling frequency is not observed up to the X-ray band. This can only be explained if the source is moving at least at a mildly relativistic velocity. We find a lower limit on the source's bulk Lorentz factor of >2.1

We perform an extensive analysis of the features of the phase transition leading twin-star configurations and, at the same time, fulfilling the constraints coming from the maximum mass 2Msun information following gravitational-wave event GW170817. Finally, combining all observational information available, we set constraints on the parameters that characterise the phase transition, the maximum masses, and the radii of 1.4Msun stars described by equations of state leading to twin-star configurations.

authors: Giacomo Fragione, Evgeni Grishin, Nathan W. C. Leigh, Hagai. B. Perets, Rosalba Perna
topic: SMBH, which acts as a perturber and may enhance BH and NS mergers via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We follow-up previous studies, but for the first time perform an extensive statistical study of BH-BH, NS-NS and BH-NS binary mergers by means of direct high-precision regularized N-body. We also compare our results to the secular approximation, and show that N-body simulations generally predict a larger number of mergers. Finally, these events can also be observable via their electromagnetic counterparts, thus making these compact object mergers especially valuable for cosmological and astrophysical purposes.

title: Hypermassive Neutron Star Disk Outflows and Blue Kilonovae
authors: Steven Fahlman, Rodrigo Fernández
topic: We study mass ejection from accretion disks around newly-formed hypermassive neutron stars (HMNS). Standard kilonova model fits to GW170817 require at least a lanthanide-poor ('blue') and lanthanide-rich ('red') component. but average disk outflow velocities from existing long-term HMNS simulations fall short of the inferred value 0.25c.  Here we use time-dependent, axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of HMNS disks to explore the limits of the model and its ability to account for observations. For physically plausible parameter choices compatible with GW170817, we find that hydrodynamic models that use shear viscosity to transport angular momentum cannot eject matter with mass-averaged velocities larger than \sim 0.15c. While outflow velocities in our simulations can exceed the asymptotic value for a steady-state neutrino-driven wind, the increase in the average velocity due to viscosity is not sufficient. Therefore, viscous HMNS disk winds cannot reproduce by themselves the ejecta properties inferred from multi-component fits to kilonova light curves from GW170817

authors: Mariusz Tarnopolski
topic: existance of an intermedate GRB, between sGRB and lGRB, by analysing statistics of GRB. It is found that the best description is given by a two-component mixture of skewed Student-t distributions, which outperforms any other model considered. This implies that the distribution of the studied parameters is intrinsically skewed, introducing spurious Gaussian components, and hence the third class is unlikely to be a real phenomenon. Its existence, based on statistical inference, is therefore rejected as unnecessary to explain the observations.

authors: Yuan-Zhu Wang, Dong-Sheng Shao, Jin-Liang Jiang, Shao-Peng Tang, Xiao-Xiao Ren, Fu-Wen Zhang, Zhi-Ping Jin, Yi-Zhong Fan, Da-Ming Wei 
topic: In this work we use the results of these modeling (off-axis energetic relativistic outflow component launched) to examine the energy extraction process of the central engine. We show that the magnetic process (i.e., the Blandford-Znajek mechanism) is favored, while the neutrino process usually requires a too massive accretion disk if the duration of the central engine activity is comparable to the observed. We propose that the GRB observations are helpful to constrain the combined tidal parameter by adopting the accretion disk mass distribution estimated in BZ mechanism.

The merger of neutron stars would leave behind a short pulse of electromagnetic synchrotron radiation even if the neutrino jet in the merger points away from the neutrino detectors.

authors: K. P. Mooley, D. A. Frail, D. Dobie, E. Lenc, A. Corsi, K. De, A.J. Nayana, S. Makhathini, I. Heywood et al
topic: We present new 0.6-10 GHz observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 covering the period up to 300 days post-merger, taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and the MeerKAT telescope. Such a slope cannot be produced by a quasi-isotropic (cocoon-dominated) outflow, but is instead the classic signature of a relativistic jet. This provides strong observational evidence that GW170817 produced a successful jet, and directly demonstrates the link between binary neutron star mergers and short-hard GRBs. Using simple analytical arguments, we derive constraints on the geometry and the jet opening angle of GW170817. These results are consistent with those from our companion Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) paper, reporting superluminal motion in GW170817.

The EM likelihood is constructed from a fit to a large number of numerical relativity simulations which we combine with a lower bound on the mass of the remnant's accretion disk inferred from the modeling of the EM light curve. In comparison with previous works, our analysis yields a more precise determination of the tidal deformability of the binary, for which the EM data provide a lower bound, and of the mass ratio of the binary, with the EM data favoring a smaller mass asymmetry.

title: Jet launching from binary black hole-neutron star mergers: Dependence on black hole spin, binary mass ratio and magnetic field orientation
authors: Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro, Antonios Tsokaros
topic: sing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNS undergoing merger we showed that a magnetically--driven jet can be launched by the remnant if the NS is endowed with a dipole B field extending from the interior into the exterior as in a radio pulsar. Here, as a crucial step in establishing BHNS systems as viable progenitors of central engines that power short gamma--ray bursts (sGRBs) and thereby solidify their role as multimessenger sources, we survey different BHNS configurations that differ in BH spin. By the time we terminate our simulations, we do not observe either an outflow or a large-scale B field collimation in the other configurations we simulate. These results suggest that future multimessenger detections from BHNSs are more likely produced by binaries with highly spinning BH companions and small tilt-angle B fields.

authors: Z. G. Dai
topic: In this paper, we have investigated rotation-induced gravitational radiation from possibly existing, radially oscillating pulsars after binary neutron star mergers, and find that this mechanism can efficiently damp the radial oscillations. The resulting gravitational waves (GWs) could have a non-negligible contribution to the high-frequency spectrum. We provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of the event rate and suggest that such GW events would be detectable with the advanced LIGO/Virgo or next-generation detectors. Our discussion can also be applied to newborn, radially oscillating, millisecond pulsars formed through the other astrophysical processes.

topic: We show that a long-lived magnetized NS with a poloidal field is fully consistent with the electromagnetic dataset, when spin down losses are dominated by gravitational wave (GW) emission. The required ellipticity can result from a toroidal magnetic field component much stronger than the poloidal component, a configuration expected from a NS newly formed from a merger. Abrupt magnetic dissipation of the toroidal component can lead to the appearance of X-ray flares, analogous to the one observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. we identify a low-significance  temporal feature at 155 d, consistent with a sudden reactivation of the central NS. Energy injection from the NS spin down into the relativistic shock is negligible, and the underlying continuum is fully accounted for by a structured jet seen off-axis.

title: r-process enrichment of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies by fast merging double neutron stars
authors: Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Jeff. J. Andrews, Tassos Fragos, Phillip Macias, Evan Scannapieco
topic: However, it is difficult to reconcile the large natal kicks and long average merging times of Double Neutron Stars (DNSs), with the levels of r-process enrichment seen in ultra faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies such as Reticulum II and Tucana III. Assuming that such dwarf systems have lost a significant fraction of their stellar mass through tidal stripping, we conclude that contrary to most current models, it is the DNSs with rather large natal kicks but very short merging timescales that can enrich UFD-type galaxies. These binaries are either on highly eccentric orbits, or form with very short separations due to an additional mass-transfer between the first-born neutron star and a naked helium star, progenitor of the second-born neutron star. These DNSs are born with a frequency that agrees with the statistics of the r-process UFDs, and merge well within the virial radius of their host halos, therefore contributing significantly to their r-process enrichment.

authors: Shlomo Dado, Arnon Dar
topic: The two leading theoretical models of GRBs and their afterglows, the fireball model and the cannonball model, have been widely confronted with the mounting observational data on GRBs and SHBs during the last two decades. Both have claimed success in reproducing the observational data, despite their complexity and diversity. This claimed success, however, may reflect multiple choices and the use of many free adjustable parameters, rather than the true validity of the models. Only confrontation of the key falsifiable predictions of the models with solid observational data can test their validity. Such critical tests are summarized in this report. Conclusions left to the reader.

title: Nonthermal afterglow of the binary neutron star merger GW170817: a more natural modeling of electron energy distribution leads to a qualitatively different new solution
authors: Haoxiang Lin, Tomonori Totani, Kenta Kiuchi
topic: nonthermal afterglow  -- synchrotron radiation by shock-accelerated electrons. Assumption:  all electrons in the shock are accelerated as a nonthermal population, affecting the peak frequency of the afterglow spectrum. Here we present Bayesian fitting to the observed data with a more natural electron energy distribution, in which the acceleration efficiency is a free parameter. Interestingly, the maximum likelihood solutions are found with radio flux below numax in the early phase, in contrast to previous studies that found the radio frequency always above numax. The jet energy and interstellar medium density are increased by 1--2 orders of magnitude from the conventional modeling, though these are still consistent with other constraints.

title: Pre-merger electromagnetic counterparts of binary compact stars
authors: Jie-Shuang Wang, Fang-Kun Peng, Kinwah Wu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: We investigate emission signatures of binary compact star gravitational wave sources consisting of strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs) and/or white dwarfs (WDs) in their late-time inspiral phase. Because of electromagnetic interactions between the magnetospheres of the two compact stars, a substantial amount of energy will be extracted in the last few seconds before the two stars merge, when the binary system contains a NS with a surface magnetic field 10 to 12 gauss. The induced electric field in the process can accelerate charged particles up to the EeV energy range. Synchrotron radiation is emitted from energetic electrons, with radiative energies reaching the GeV energy for binary NSs and the MeV energy for NS - WD or double WD binaries. In addition, a blackbody component is also presented and it peaks at several to hundreds keV for binary NSs and at several keV for NS - WD or double WD binaries. The strong angular dependence of the synchrotron radiation and the isotropic nature of the blackbody radiation lead to distinguishable modulation patterns between the two emission components. If coherent curvature radiation is presented, fast radio bursts could be produced.

title: The neutron star merger GW170817 points to collapsars as the main r-process source
authors: Daniel M. Siegel, Jennifer Barnes, Brian D. Metzger
topic: Here we show that collapsar accretion disks also produce neutron-rich outflows that synthesize heavy r-process nuclei, despite the comparatively proton-rich composition of the infalling star. Though occurring less frequently than mergers, the much greater accreted mass in collapsars---and their correspondingly larger disk wind ejecta---implicate them as dominant contributors to the Galactic r-process. Collapsars provide the rare r-process source needed to promptly enrich a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies early in the Universe which is also compatible with the Galactic chemical enrichment of europium relative to iron over longer timescales. We predict an excess in the late-time near-infrared emission from GRB supernovae, testable by future observations.

authors: David Radice, Albino Perego, Kenta Hotokezaka, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Steven A. Fromm, Luke F. Roberts
topic: General-relativistic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with viscosity reveal a new outflow mechanism operating in unequal mass binaries on dynamical timescales and enabled by turbulent viscosity. These "viscous-dynamical" ejecta are launched during merger due to the thermalization of mass exchange streams between the secondary and the primary neutron star. They are characterized by asymptotic velocities extending up to 0.8c. The radioactive decay of the expanding viscous-dynamical ejecta could produce bright kilonova transients with signatures of free neutron decay in the first hour and enhanced near infrared flux on a timescale of a few days. The synchrotron remnant produced by the interaction between the ejecta and the interstellar medium could also be significantly enhanced by viscosity. Such remnant could be detected in the case of GW170817 as a rebrightening of the radio signal in the next months to years.

We examine both simple isolated dwarf disc galaxies and cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-type galaxies, and compare the (Eu/Fe) and (Eu/{\alpha}) evolution with recent observations, including the HERMES-GALAH survey. We find that neither electron-capture supernovae or neutrino-driven winds are able to adequately produce heavy neutron-capture elements such as Eu in quantities to match observations. Both neutron-star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae are able to produce these elements in sufficient quantities.

In thick disc stars, the ratio is found to be constant, while the and  ratios decrease as a function of the metallicity.  These observations clearly indicate a different nucleosynthesis history in the thick disc between Eu and Gd-Dy. We also find that the alpha-rich metal-rich stars are also enriched in r-process elements. his data may help to constrain chemical evolution models of Milky Way r- and s-process elements and the yields of massive stars.

title: Constraining the Outflow Structure of the Binary Neutron Star Merger Event GW170817 with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Analysis
authors: Yiyang Wu, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We utilize a physically motivated analytic two-parameter model called the "boosted fireball" for the outflow structure after it has expanded far from the merger site and has entered the self-similar coasting phase. This model consists of a family of outflows with a structure varying smoothly between a highly collimated ultra-relativistic jet and an isotropic fireball. We simulate the dynamical evolution, starting with "boosted fireball" initial conditions, of 240 outflows using the moving-mesh relativistic hydrodynamics code JET to follow their evolution through the afterglow phase. We compute synchrotron spectra from the hydrodynamic simulations using the standard synchrotron radiation model. We develop a synthetic light curve generator with an efficient sampling speed. Our results favor the relativistic structured jet, with a jet opening angle \sim 5 deg and Lorentz factor \sim 175, viewed from an off-axis angle of 27(+9-3) deg.

topic:  it remains unclear whether and how the central engine can produce such structured jets. Here, we utilize 3D GRMHD simulations starting with a black hole surrounded by a magnetized torus with properties typically expected of a post-merger system. We follow the jet, as it is self-consistently launched, from the scale of the compact object out to more than 3 orders of magnitude in distance. We find that this naturally results in a structured jet, which is collimated by the disk wind into a half-opening angle of roughly 10 degrees, its emission can explain features of both the prompt and afterglow emission of GRB170817A for a 30 degree observing angle. Our work is the first to compute the afterglow, in the context of a binary merger, from a relativistic magnetized jet self-consistently generated by an accreting black hole, with the jet's transverse structure determined by the accretion physics and not prescribed at any point.

authors: Benoit Côté, Marius Eichler, Almudena Arcones, Camilla J. Hansen, Paolo Simonetti, Anna Frebel, Chris L. Fryer, Marco Pignatari, Moritz Reichert, Krzysztof Belczynski, Francesca Matteucci 
topic: We review the observational evidence that probe the properties of r-process sites, and address them using galactic chemical evolution simulations, binary population synthesis models, and nucleosynthesis calculations. Our motivation is to define which astrophysical sites have significantly contributed to the total mass of r-process elements present in our Galaxy. We found discrepancies with the neutron star (NS-NS) merger scenario. One solution is to assume an extra production site of Eu that would be active in the early universe, but would fade away with increasing metallicity. If this is correct, this extra site could be responsible for roughly 50% of the Eu production in the early universe, before the onset of Type~Ia supernovae. Rare classes of supernovae could be this additional r-process source, but hydrodynamic simulations still need to ensure the conditions for a robust r-process pattern.

title: Kilonova emission from black hole-neutron star mergers: observational signatures of anisotropic mass ejection
authors: Zhi-Qiu Huang, Liang-Duan Liu, Xiang-Yu Wang, Zi-Gao Dai
topic:  In this paper, we investigate observational signatures of kilonova emission from the anisotropic ejecta in BH-NS mergers. We find that a bump appears on the bolometric luminosity light curve due to the inhomogeneous mass distribution in the latitudinal direction. The decay slope of the single-band light curve becomes flatter and the spectrum also deviates from a single-temperature blackbody radiation spectrum due to the gradient in the velocity distribution of the ejecta. Future detection or non-detection of such signatures would be useful to test the mass ejection geometry in BH-NS mergers.

topic: A unified chiral mean field approach is presented for QCD thermodynamics in a wide range of temperatures and densities. The model simultaneously gives a satisfactory description of lattice QCD thermodynamics and fulfills nuclear matter and astrophysical constraints. The resulting equation of state can be incorporated in relativistic fluid-dynamical simulations of heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars mergers. Access to different regions of the QCD phase diagram can be obtained in simulations of heavy-ion data and observations of neutron star mergers.

title: Delayed jet breakouts from binary neutron star mergers
authors: Tatsuya Matsumoto, Shigeo S. Kimura
topic: the jet may be choked and fails to produce a successful sGRB. We propose a "delayed breakout" scenario where a late-time jet launched by a long-term engine activity can penetrate ejecta even if a prompt jet is choked. Observationally, such a late-time jet is supported by the long-lasting high-energy emissions in sGRBs. Solving the jet propagation in ejecta, we show that a typical late-time activity easily achieves the delayed breakout.

Specifically, we show that the dominant postmerger GW frequency fpeak may exhibit a significant deviation from an empirical relation between fpeak and the tidal deformability if a strong first-order phase transition leads to the formation of a gravitationally stable extended quark matter core in the postmerger remnant

authors: Mukul Bhattacharya, Pawan Kumar, George Smoot
topic: Here we study the effect of the BHNS binary parameters on the merger ejecta properties and associated EM signals. We estimate the remnant disk and unbound ejecta masses for BH mass and spin distributions motivated from the observations of transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and specific NS equation of state (EoS). The amount of r-process elements synthesised in BHNS mergers is estimated to be a factor 1 -- 0.01\% of the BNS.  due to the smaller dynamical ejecta and merger rates for the former. We compute the EM luminosities and light curves for the early- and late-time emissions from the ultra-relativistic jet, sub-relativistic dynamical ejecta and wind, and the mildly-relativistic cocoon for typical ejecta parameters.

title: Fingerprints of heavy element nucleosynthesis in the late-time lightcurves of kilonovae
authors: Meng-Ru Wu, Jennifer Barnes, Gabriel Martinez-Pinedo, Brian D. Metzger
topic: At early times (~days) most of the r-process heating arises from a large statistical ensemble of beta-decays, which thermalize efficiently while the ejecta is still dense, generating a heating rate that is reasonably approximated by a single power-law. However, at later times (weeks to months), the decay energy input can possibly be dominated by a discrete number of alpha-decays following the beta-decay of 225Ra which liberate more energy per decay and thermalize with greater efficiency than beta-decay products. Late-time nebular observations of kilonovae which constrain the radioactive power provide the potential to identify signatures of these individual isotopes, thus confirming the production of heavy nuclei. In order to constrain the bolometric light to the required accuracy, multi-epoch & wide-band observations are required with sensitive instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope

title: Radioactive \gamma-Ray Emissions from Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Li-Xin Li
topic: According to the theoretical model, the optical radiation from a neutron star merger originates from the radioactive decay of unstable nuclides freshly synthesized in the merger ejecta. In about a day the ejecta transits from an optically thick state to an optically thin state due to its subrelativistic expansion. Hence, we expect that about a day after the merger, the gamma-ray photons produced by radioactive decays start to escape from the ejecta and make it bright in the MeV band. In this paper, we study the features of the radioactive gamma-ray emission from a neutron star merger, including the brightness and the spectrum, and discuss the observability of the gamma-ray emission. Under favorable conditions, a prominent pair annihilation line can be present in the gamma-ray spectrum. Requires D less 12Mpc.

topic: Here, we implement empirically derived inter-correlated distributions of initial binary parameters primary mass (M1), mass ratio (q), orbital period (P), and eccentricity (e). Unexpectedly, the introduction of inter-correlated initial binary parameters leads to only a small decrease in the predicted merger rates by a factor of 2 − 3 relative to the previously used non-correlated initial distributions. The formation of compact object mergers in the isolated classical binary evolution favors initial binaries with stars of comparable masses (q = 0.5 − 1) at intermediate orbital periods (log P (days) = 2 − 4)

Here we explore some of the observational consequences of this structured emission, taking the reconstructed angular emission profile of gamma-ray burst GRB170817A to be typical. We calculate the expected fraction of gravitational-wave observations from BNS mergers that will have an observed GRB counterpart to be \sim 30\%, implying that joint gravitational-wave and GRB observations will be common. Further, we find that \sim 10% of observed short GRBs occur within 200 Mpc. Finally, we estimate a BNS merger rate of 500

title: Are fast radio bursts the most likely electromagnetic counterpart of neutron star mergers resulting in prompt collapse?
authors: Vasileios Paschalidis, Milton Ruiz
topic: Moreover, we find that most models of the BNS mass function we study here predict that the majority of prompt-collapse BNS mergers have q greater 0.8. Prompt-collapse BNS mergers with mass ratio may not be accompanied by detectable kilonovae or short gamma-ray bursts, because they unbind a negligible amount of mass and form negligibly small accretion disks onto the remnant black hole. We call such BNS mergers "orphan". Through simulations in full general relativity of BNSs endowed with an initial dipole magnetosphere, we find that the energy in the magnetosphere following black hole formation is  in 1 ms, as has been found in previous studies, matches the premerger magnetospheric luminosity. These magnetospheric signals are not beamed, and their duration and power agrees with those of non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs).

title: Physical conditions for the r-process I. radioactive energy sources of kilonovae
authors: Shinya Wanajo
topic: In previous studies power-law-type heating rates have frequently been used, which may be inadequate if the ejecta are dominated by nuclei other than the A ~ 130 region. We consider, therefore, two reference abundance distributions that match the r-process residuals to the solar abundances for A above 69 (light trans-iron plus r-process elements) and A above 90 (r-process elements). Nucleosynthetic abundances are obtained by using free-expansion models with three parameters: expansion velocity, entropy, and electron fraction. Radioactive energies are calculated as an ensemble of weighted free-expansion models that reproduce the reference abundance patterns. The results are compared with the bolometric luminosity (above a few days since merger) of the kilonova associated with GW170817. If this is the case, the event GW170817 is best explained by the production of both light trans-iron and r-process elements that originate from dynamical ejecta and subsequent disk outflows from the neutron star merger.

title: Stochastic Chemical Evolution of Galactic Subhalos and the Origin of r-Process Elements
authors: Takuya Ojima, Yuhri Ishimaru, Shinya Wanajo, Nikos Prantzos, Patrick Francois
topic: the average coalescence timescale of NSMs appears to be > 100 Myr. most of previous chemical evolution models indicate that the observed early appearance and large dispersion of [r/Fe] in Galactic halo stars at [Fe/H] less -2.5 favors shorter coalescence times of 1-10 Myr. We argue that this is not the case for the models assuming the formation of the Galactic halo from clustering of subhalos with different star formation histories as suggested by Ishimaru et al. (2015). We present a stochastic chemical evolution model of the subhalos, in which the site of the r-process is assumed to be mainly NSMs with a coalescence timescale of 100 Myr.  Our results show that the less massive subhalos evolve at lower metallicities and generate highly r-process-enhanced stars. An assembly of these subhalos leaves behind the large star-to-star scatters of [r/Fe] in the Galactic halo as observed. However, the observed scatters of [Sr/Ba] at low metallicities indicate the presence of an additional site that partially contributes to the enrichment of light neutron-capture elements such as Sr.

authors: G. Ghirlanda, O. S. Salafia, Z. Paragi, A. Perego, et al
topic: The binary neutron star merger event GW170817 was detected through both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. Its afterglow emission may have been produced by either a narrow relativistic jet or an isotropic outflow. High spatial resolution measurements of the source size and displacement can discriminate between these scenarios. We present Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations, performed 207.4 days after the merger, using a global network of 32 radio telescopes. The apparent source size is constrained to be smaller than 2.5 milliarcseconds at the 90% confidence level. This excludes the isotropic outflow scenario, which would have produced a larger apparent size, indicating that GW170817 produced a structured relativistic jet.

authors: Rodrigo Fernández, Alexander Tchekhovskoy, Eliot Quataert, Francois Foucart, Daniel Kasen
topic: We investigate the long-term evolution of black hole accretion disks formed in neutron star mergers. These disks expel matter that contributes to an r-process kilonova, and can produce relativistic jets powering short gamma-ray bursts. Here we report the results of a three-dimensional, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of such a disk which is evolved for long enough 6s to achieve completion of mass ejection far from the disk. Our model starts with a poloidal field, and fully resolves the most unstable mode of the magnetorotational instability. We parameterize the dominant microphysics and neutrino cooling effects, and compare with axisymmetric hydrodynamic models with shear viscosity. The GRMHD model ejects mass in two ways: a prompt MHD-mediated outflow and a late-time, thermally-driven wind once the disk becomes advective. The total amount of unbound mass ejected (0.013Msun, or \approx 40\% of the initial torus mass) is twice as much as in hydrodynamic models, with higher average velocity (0.1c) and a broad electron fraction distribution with a lower average value (0.16).

authors: Ricard Ardevol-Pulpillo, H.-Thomas Janka, Oliver Just, Andreas Bauswein
topic: We present a new, computationally efficient, energy-integrated approximation for neutrino effects in hot and dense astrophysical environments such as supernova cores and compact binary mergers and their remnants. Our new method, termed ILEAS for Improved Leakage-Equilibration-Absorption Scheme, improves the lepton-number and energy losses of traditional leakage descriptions by a novel prescription of the diffusion time-scale based on a detailed energy integral of the flux-limited diffusion equation. The leakage module is supplemented by a neutrino-equilibration treatment that ensures the proper evolution of the total lepton number and medium plus neutrino energies as well as neutrino-pressure effects in the neutrino-trapping domain. Moreover, we employ a simple and straightforwardly applicable ray-tracing algorithm for including re-absorption of escaping neutrinos especially in the decoupling layer and during the transition to semi-transparent conditions. ILEAS is implemented on a three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian grid with a minimum of free and potentially case-dependent parameters and exploits the basic physics constraints that should be fulfilled in the neutrino-opaque and free-streaming limits.

topic:  Simulations of r-process nucleosynthesis, so far fail to account for the observed over-enhancement of actinides. In this work, we investigate actinide production in the dynamical ejecta of a neutron star merger and explore if varying levels of neutron richness can reproduce the actinide boost. We also investigate the sensitivity of actinide production on nuclear physics properties: fission distribution, beta-decay, and mass model. For most cases, the actinides are over-produced in our models if the initial conditions are sufficiently neutron-rich for fission cycling. We find that actinide production can be so robust in the dynamical ejecta that an additional lanthanide-rich, actinide-poor component is necessary in order to match observations of actinide-boost stars. We present a simple actinide-dilution model that folds in estimated contributions from two nucleosynthetic sites within a merger event. Our study suggests that while the dynamical ejecta of a neutron star merger is a likely production site for the formation of actinides, a significant contribution from another site or sites (e.g., the neutron star merger accretion disk wind) is required to explain abundances of r-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars.

This calculation is performed using the same EoS for merger components and for low spin prior case. It is found from the computations of tidal deformability parameters that soft to moderately stiff equations of state are allowed by the 50\% and 90\% credible regions obtained from the gravitational wave observation of binary neutron star merger GW170817, whereas the stiffest hadron-quark EoS which lies above the upper 90% limit, is ruled out. A correlation among the tidal deformabilities and masses is found to exist as already predicted. Furthermore moments of inertia and quadrupole moments of merger components of GW170817 are estimated.

We then combine the H0 values from all the galaxies to provide a final measurement of H0.

In this paper, we propose that the polarimetric observation can be a useful tool to study the early macronova emissions.

authors: L. Jens Papenfort, Roman Gold, Luciano Rezzolla
topic:  we investigate the dynamics, gravitational-wave emission, and nucleosynthetic yields of numerous eccentric binary neutron-star mergers having different equations of state. For each equation of state we vary the orbital properties around th we couple the dynamical ejecta output from the simulations to the nuclear-reaction network code \texttt{SkyNet} to compute nucleosynthetic yields and compare to the corresponding results in the case of a quasi-circular merger. We find that the amount and velocity of dynamically ejected material is always much larger than in the quasi-circular case, reaching maximal valuese threshold of immediate merger, as well as the binary mass ratio. At the same time, the properties of this material are rather insensitive to the details of the orbit. urthermore, while the composition of the ejected matter depends on the orbital parameters and on the equation of state, the relative nucleosynthetic yields do not, thus indicating that kilonova signatures could provide information on the orbital properties of dynamically captured neutron-star binaries.

All three stars show remarkable agreement with the scaled solar r-process pattern for elements above Ba, consistent with enrichment of the birth gas cloud by a neutron star merger. The abundances for Sr, Y, and Zr, however, deviate from the scaled solar pattern. This indicates that more than one distinct r-process site might be responsible for the observed neutron-capture element abundance pattern. Thorium was detected in J1432-4125 and J2005-3057. Age estimates for J1432-4125 and J2005-3057 were adopted from one of two sets of initial production ratios each by assuming the stars are old.

title: Radioactive Heating and Late Time Kilonova Light Curves
authors: Daniel Kasen, Jennifer Barnes
topic:  The luminosity of kilonova light curves depends on the efficiency with which beta-decay electrons are thermalized in the ejecta. Here we derive a simple analytic solution for thermalization by calculating how electrons accumulate in the ejecta and lose energy adiabatically and via plasma losses. We find that the time-dependent thermalization efficiency is well described by [law] is a function of the ejecta mass and velocity. For a statistical distribution of r-process isotopes with radioactive power [law] the late time kilonova luminosity asymptotes to [law] depends super-linearly on the ejecta mass [law] If a kilonova is instead powered by a single dominate isotope, we show that the late time luminosity can deviate substantially from the underlying exponential decay and eventually become brighter than the instantaneous radioactivity due to the accumulation of trapped electrons. Applied to the kilonova associated with the gravitational wave source GW170817, these results imply that a possible steepening of the observed light curve at ≳7 days is unrelated to thermalization effects and instead could mark the onset of translucency in a high opacity component of ejecta. The analytic results should be convenient for estimating the properties of observed kilonovae and assessing the potential late time detectability of future events.

title: The Location and Environments of Neutron Star Mergers in an Evolving Universe
authors: Brandon K. Wiggins, Christopher L. Fryer, Joseph M. Smidt, Dieter H. Hartmann, Nicole Lloyd-Ronning, Chris Belcynski
topic: While long-duration GRBs originate from massive stars and thus are located near their stellar nurseries, binary neutron stars may merge on much longer timescales, and thus may have had time to migrate appreciably. The strength and character of the electromagnetic afterglow emission of binary neutron star mergers is a sensitive function of the circum-merger environment. Though the explosion sites of short GRBs have been explored in the literature, the question has yet to be fully addressed in its cosmological context. We present cosmological simulations following the evolution of a galaxy cluster including star formation combined with binary population synthesis models to self-consistently track the locations and environmental gas densities of compact binary merger sites throughout the cosmic web. We present probability distributions for densities as a function of redshift and discuss model sensitivity to population synthesis model assumptions.

authors: Francois Foucart, Tanja Hinderer, Samaya Nissanke
topic: Gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals from the merger of a Neutron Star (NS) and a Black Hole (BH) are a highly anticipated discovery in extreme gravity, nuclear-, and astrophysics. We develop a simple formula that distinguishes between merger outcomes and predicts the post-merger remnant mass, validated with 75 simulations. Our formula improves on existing results by describing critical unexplored regimes: comparable masses and higher BH spins. These are important to differentiate NSNS from NSBH mergers, and to infer source physics from EM signals

title: Late afterglows of GW/GRB 170817A
authors: Houri Ziaeepour
topic: In a previous work we used a phenomenological formulation of relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission to analyse the prompt gamma-ray emission of GW/GRB 170817A. Here we use the same model to analyse late afterglows of this event. The main goal is to see whether synchrotron emission alone can explain late afterglows. This is true, if the synchrotron self-absorption of radio emission and extinction of optical/IR photons are taken into account. Alternatively, an additional source of X-ray is necessary to explain the data. These conclusions are independent of the model used here and can be deduced directly from data. We also show that at the time of its encounter with circumburst material the outflow could have been still mildly magnetized.

topic: Here we show that GRB150101B was an analogue of GRB170817A located at a cosmological distance. GRB 150101B was a faint short duration GRB characterized by a bright optical counterpart and a long-lived X-ray afterglow. These properties are unusual for standard short GRBs and are instead consistent with an explosion viewed off-axis: the optical light is produced by a luminous kilonova component, while the observed X-rays trace the GRB afterglow viewed at an angle of \sim 13 degrees. Our findings suggest that these properties could be common among future electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources.

title: Jet Dynamics in Compact Object Mergers: GW170817 Likely had a Successful Jet
authors: Paul C. Duffell, Eliot Quataert, Daniel Kasen, Hannah Klion
topic: We use relativistic hydrodynamic numerical calculations to study the interaction between a jet and a homologous outflow produced dynamically during binary neutron star mergers. We quantify how the thermal energy supplied by the jet to the ejecta and the ability of a jet to escape the homologous ejecta depend on the parameters of the jet engine and the ejecta. For collimated jets initiated at early times compared to the engine duration, we show that successful breakout of the forward cocoon shock necessitates a jet that successfully escapes the ejecta. This is because the ejecta is expanding and absorbing thermal energy, so that the forward shock from a failed jet stalls before it reaches the edge of the ejecta. This conclusion can be circumvented only for very energetic wide angle jets, with parameters that are uncomfortable given short-duration GRB observations. For successful jets, we find two regimes of jet breakout from the ejecta, early breakout on timescales shorter than the engine duration, and late breakout well after the engine shuts off. A late breakout can explain the observed delay between gravitational waves and gamma rays in GW 170817.

authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Ehud Nakar, Ore Gottlieb, Samaya Nissanke, Kento Masuda, Gregg Hallinan, Kunal P. Mooley, Adam. T. Deller
topic: In this analysis, the degeneracy in the GW signal between the source distance and the weakly constrained viewing angle dominated the H0 measurement uncertainty. ecently, Mooley et al. (2018) obtained tight constraints on the viewing angle using high angular resolution imaging of the radio counterpart of GW170817. Here we obtain a significantly improved measurement H0=68.9+4.7−4.6 km/s/Mpc by using these new radio observations, combined with the previous GW and EM data. We estimate that 15 more localized GW170817-like events (comparable signal-to-noise ratio, favorable orientation), having radio images and light curve data, will potentially bring resolution to the tension between the Planck and Cepheid-supernova measurements, as compared to 50-100 GW events without such data.

topic: We present a covariant ray tracing algorithm for computing high-resolution neutrino distributions in general relativistic numerical spacetimes with hydrodynamical sources. Our formulation treats the very important effect of elastic scattering of neutrinos off of nuclei and nucleons (changing the neutrino's direction but not energy) by incorporating estimates of the background neutrino fields. Background fields provide information about the spectra and intensities of the neutrinos scattered into each ray. These background fields may be taken from a low-order moment simulation or be ignored, in which case the method reduces to a standard state-of-the-art ray tracing formulation. The method handles radiation in regimes spanning optically thick to optically thin.

This is due to the anomalously long half-life of this isotope and the efficiency of fission thermalization compared to other nuclear channels. We estimate the fission fragment yield of this nucleus and outline the astrophysical conditions under which 254Cf has the greatest impact to the light curve. Future observations in the middle-IR which are bright during this regime could indicate the production of actinide nucleosynthesis.

authors: K. P. Mooley, A. T. Deller, O. Gottlieb, E. Nakar, G. Hallinan, S. Bourke , D.A. Frail, A. Horesh, A. Corsi, K. Hotokezaka
topic: To date, various models have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a choked-jet cocoon and a successful-jet cocoon (a.k.a. structured jet). However, the observational data have remained inconclusive as to whether GW170817 launched a successful relativistic jet. Here we show, through Very Long Baseline Interferometry, that the compact radio source associated with GW170817 exhibits superluminal motion between two epochs at 75 and 230 days post-merger. This measurement breaks the degeneracy between the models and indicates that, while the early-time radio emission was powered by a wider-angle outflow (cocoon), the late-time emission was most likely dominated by an energetic and narrowly-collimated jet, with an opening angle of \less 5 degrees, and observed from a viewing angle of about 20 degrees.

authors: Anna Frebel
topic: Old stars found in the Milky Way and its dwarf satellite galaxies can provide answers because they preserve clean elemental patterns of the nucleosynthesis processes that operated some 13 billion years ago. This enables the reconstruction of the chemical evolution of the elements. Here we focus on the astrophysical signatures of heavy neutron-capture elements made in the s-, i- and r-process found in old stars. A highlight is the recently discovered r-process galaxy Reticulum II that was apparently enriched by a neutron star merger. These results show that old stars in dwarf galaxies provide a novel means to constrain the astrophysical site of the r-process, ushering in much needed progress on this major outstanding question.

title: Radio sky maps of the GRB 170817A afterglow from simulations
authors: Jonathan Zrake, Xiaoyi Xie, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We present synthetic radio images of the GRB170817A afterglow, computed from moving-mesh hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star merger outflows. Having expanded for nearly a year, the merger remnant is expected to subtend roughly 5 milli-arcseconds (mas) on the sky, potentially resolvable by very long baseline radio imaging techniques. Any observations revealing the radio centroid to be offset from the line-of-site to the merger would be the smoking gun of a jetted outflow. We find that in both scenarios, the centroid exhibits superluminal proper motion away from the merger site at roughly 4 - 10 mas per day for at least the first 300 days. We argue that a successful strategy for differentiating among the explosion models will need to include multiple observations over the coming months - years. In particular, we find the time at which the centroid attains its maximum offset, and begins heading back toward the merger site, is considerably later if the jet was choked.

authors: Ben Margalit, Brian D. Metzger, Edo Berger, Matt Nicholl, Tarraneh Eftekhari, Raffaella Margutti
topic: However, a barrier to direct confirmation of the magnetar hypothesis is the challenge of directly observing non-thermal emission from the central engine at early times (when it is most powerful and thus detectable) due to the dense surrounding ejecta. We present CLOUDY calculations of the time-dependent evolution of the temperature and ionization structure of expanding supernova or merger ejecta due to photo-ionization by a magnetar engine, in order to study the escape of X-rays (absorbed by neutral gas) and radio waves (absorbed by ionized gas), as well as to assess the evolution of the local dispersion measure due to photo-ionization. We find that ionization breakout does not occur if the engine's ionizing luminosity decays rapidly, and that X-rays typically escape the oxygen-rich ejecta of SLSNe only on \sim 100yr timescales, consistent with current X-ray non-detections. We apply these results to constrain engine-driven models for the binary NS merger GW170817 and the luminous transient ASASSN-15lh.

title: On GW170817 and the Galactic Binary Neutron Star Population
authors: Chris Pankow
topic: Electromagnetic observations and model fitting of the ejecta properties from the subsequent kilonova detection provided values of the ejecta mass from the merger. These values, when combined with the gravitational-wave measurement disfavors an equal-mass configuration, with the level of disagreement dependent on the assumed amount of ejecta mass of dynamical origin. Within the confines of our own galaxy, several binary neutron star systems along with measurements of their component masses have been made. If those distributions are indicative of a universal distribution, the joint measurement of the component masses of GW170817 represents an outlier. This tension is not easily resolvable from physical arguments, as the proposed pathways which form binary neutron stars do not often produce very asymmetrical pairs. Even accounting for the uncertainty associated with the total mass of the dynamical ejecta, this tension suggests that the distribution of binary neutron star masses in the galaxy is not indicative of those in other galaxies.

authors: Zong-Kai Peng, Shan-Qin Wang, Liang-Duan Liu, Zi-Gao Dai, Hai Yu
topic:  In this paper, we adopt a unified afterglow model that takes into account the non-relativistic effect and jet effect and use the upper limits of four bands (5.5 GHz, 7.5 GHz, U-band, and X-ray) to obtain more stringent constraints on the parameter space spanned by \epsilon_B and n. We thus suggest that FRB 131104/Swift J0644.5-5111 might originate from a black hole-neutron star merger event. Moreover, we calculate multi-band emissions from a kilonova powered by the radioactivity of r-process elements synthesized in the ejected neutron-rich material and find that the U-band emission from the putative kilonova is significantly lower than the upper limit of the observations.

topic: We present late-time radio observations of GW170817, the first binary neutron star merger discovered through gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. Our observations, carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, were optimized to detect polarized radio emission, and thus to constrain the linear polarization fraction of GW170817. At an epoch of \sim 244 days after the merger, we rule out linearly polarized emission above a fraction of ~1\2 \% at a frequency of 2.8 GHz (99\% confidence). Within the structured jet scenario (a.k.a. successful jet plus cocoon system) for GW170817, the derived upper-limit on the radio continuum linear polarization fraction strongly constrains the magnetic field configuration in the shocked ejecta. We show that our results for GW170817 are compatible with the low level of linear polarization found in afterglows of cosmological long gamma-ray bursts. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of future expectations for the study of radio counterparts of binary neutron star mergers identified by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.

title: Evaluating radiation transport errors in merger simulations using a Monte-Carlo algorithm
authors: Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, Lawerence E. Kidder, Ronny Nguyen, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: Unfortunately, Boltzmann's equations of radiation transport remain too costly to be evolved directly in merger simulations. Simulations rely instead on approximate transport algorithms with unquantified modeling errors. In this paper, we use for the first time a time-dependent general relativistic Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm to solve Boltzmann's equations and estimate important properties of the neutrino distribution function \sim 10ms after a neutron star merger. We do not fully couple the MC algorithm to the fluid evolution, but use a short evolution of the merger remnant to critically assess errors in our approximate gray two-moment transport scheme. We demonstrate that the analytical closure used by the moment scheme is highly inaccurate in the polar regions, but performs well elsewhere. While the average energy of polar neutrinos is reasonably well captured by the two-moment scheme, estimates for the neutrino energy become less accurate at lower latitudes. The two-moment formalism also overestimates the density of neutrinos in the polar regions by \sim 50%, and underestimates the neutrino pair-annihilation rate at the poles by factors of 2-3. Although the latter is significantly more accurate than one might have expected before this study, our results indicate that predictions for the properties of polar outflows and for the creation of a baryon-free region at the poles are likely to be affected by errors in the two-moment scheme, thus limiting our ability to reliably model kilonovae and gamma-ray bursts.

We also put forward alternative strong (\sim G) magnetic field scenarios able to support this emission. For such stronger fields, the photo-disintegration of non-thermal nuclei within the source is considered, and a bottleneck period of \sim 5-30 days is found when this process peaks. We find that this class of source is in principle able to support the population of cosmic rays detected at Earth below the "ankle".

authors: Nicola Giacobbo, Michela Mapelli
topic: We investigate the impact of progenitor's metallicity, of the common-envelope parameter α and of the natal kicks on the properties of DNSs, BHNSs and BHBs. We find that neutron-star (NS) masses in DNSs span from 1.1 to 2.0 Msun, with a preference for light NSs, while NSs in merging BHNSs have mostly large masses (1.3−2.0 Msun). BHs in merging BHNSs are preferentially low mass (5−15 Msun). BH masses in merging BHBs strongly depend on the progenitor's metallicity and span from \sim 5 to \sim 45 Msun. The local merger rate density of both BHNSs and BHBs derived from our simulations is consistent with the values reported by the LVC in all our simulations. In contrast, the local merger rate density of DNSs matches the value inferred from the LVC only if low natal kicks are assumed. This result adds another piece to the intricate puzzle of natal kicks and DNS formation.

We investigate the impact of ECSNe on the formation of DNSs by means of population synthesis simulations.

The measured brightness is dimmer by a factor of about 2-3 times compared to our previously published kilonova model, which is based on UV, optical, and near-IR data at less 30 days. However, the observed fading rate and color are consistent with our model. We suggest that the discrepancy is likely due to a transition to the nebular phase, or a reduced thermalization efficiency at such late time. Using the Spitzer data as a guide, we briefly discuss the prospects of observing future binary neutron star mergers with Spitzer (in LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3) and the James Webb Space Telescope (in LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 4 and beyond).

title: On the formation history of Galactic double neutron stars
authors: Alejandro Vigna-Gómez, Coenraad J. Neijssel et al
topic:  We perform rapid population synthesis of massive binary stars and discuss model predictions, including formation rates, mass distributions, and delay time distributions. We vary assumptions and parameters of physical processes such as mass transfer stability criteria, supernova kick distributions, remnant mass distributions and common-envelope energetics. We compute the likelihood of observing the orbital period-eccentricity distribution of the Galactic DNS population under each of our population synthesis models, allowing us to quantitatively compare the models. We find that mass transfer from a stripped post-helium-burning secondary (case BB) onto a neutron star is most likely dynamically stable.

title: Particle acceleration in relativistic magnetic flux-merging events
authors: Maxim Lyutikov (Purdue), Serguei Komissarov (Leeds), Lorenzo Sironi (Columbia), Oliver Porth (Goethe-Universitat)
topic: Using analytical and numerical methods (fluid and particle-in-cell simulations) we study a number of model problems involving merger of magnetic flux tubes in relativistic magnetically-dominated plasma. Mergers of current-carrying flux tubes (exemplified by the two dimensional `ABC' structures) and zero total current magnetic flux tubes are considered.  We identify two stages of particle acceleration during flux mergers: (i) fast explosive prompt X-point collapse and (ii) ensuing island merger. The fastest acceleration occurs during the initial catastrophic X-point collapse, with the reconnection electric field of the order of the magnetic field. During the X-point collapse particles are accelerated by charge-starved electric fields, which can reach (and even exceed) values of the local magnetic field. The explosive stage of reconnection produces non-thermal power-law tails with slopes that depend on the average magnetization. The X-point collapse stage is followed by magnetic island merger that dissipates a large fraction of the initial magnetic energy in a regime of forced magnetic reconnection, further accelerating the particles, but proceeds at a slower reconnection rate.

title: Free Neutron Ejection From Shock Breakout in Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Ayako Ishii, Toshikazu Shigeyama, Masaomi Tanaka
topic: It is expected that some of such neutrons having avoided capturing positrons remain as free neutrons even after disappearance of electron-positron pairs. To investigate how many free neutrons can be ejected from merging neutron stars, we performed special-relativistic Lagrangian hydrodynamics computation with simplified models of this phenomenon in which a spherically symmetric shock wave propagates in the hydrostatic envelope and emerge from the surface. We systematically study a wide parameter space of the size of the merging neutron stars and the energy involved in the shock waves. As a result, it is found that the mass of remaining free neutron is \sim 10**-6 which is smaller than the previously expected by more than two orders of magnitude.  We briefly discuss the emission from the free neutron layer and estimate the luminosity in the optical band to be about

title: Fading of the X-ray Afterglow of Neutron Star Merger GW170817/GRB170817A at 260 days
authors: Melania Nynka, John J. Ruan, Daryl Haggard, Phil A. Evans
topic: We present new, deep Chandra observations of GW170817/GRB170817A at 260 days post-merger that reveal an X-ray flux and confirm that the X-ray light curve is now also fading. Through rigorous comparisons to previous Chandra observations of GW170817/GRB170817A, X-ray fading is detected between 160 and 260 days post-merger based on the X-ray data alone. We further constrain the X-ray photon index to steepen significance during this period, which disfavors the passing of the synchrotron cooling frequency through the X-ray band as the cause of the observed fading. These observations remain consistent with optically thin synchrotron afterglow emission. If this afterglow emission arises from a quasi-spherical mildly relativistic outflow, the X-ray fading suggests that the outflow is now decelerating. Alternatively, if this afterglow arises from a successful off-axis structured jet, the X-ray fading suggests that emission from the jet core has already entered the line of sight.

title: Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Afterglows with Two-Component Jets: Polarization Evolution Revisited
authors: Mi-Xiang Lan, Xue-Feng Wu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been widely argued to originate from binary compact object mergers or core collapses of massive stars. Jets from these systems may have two components, an inner, narrow sub-jet and an outer, wider sub-jet. Such a jet subsequently interacts with its ambient gas, leading to a reverse shock (RS) and a forward shock (FS). The magnetic field in the narrow sub-jet is very likely to be mixed by an ordered component and a random component during the afterglow phase. In this paper, we calculate light curves and polarization evolution of optical afterglows with this mixed magnetic field in the RS region of the narrow sub-jet in a two-component jet model. The resultant light curve has two peaks: an early peak arises from the narrow sub-jet and a late-time rebrightening is due to the wider sub-jet. We find the polarization degree (PD) evolution under such a mixed magnetic field confined in the shock plane is very similar to that under the purely ordered magnetic field condition

title: A Globular Cluster Luminosity Function Distance to NGC 4993 Hosting a Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817/GRB 170817A
authors: Myung Gyoon Lee, Jisu Kang, Myungshin Im
topic: NGC 4993 hosts a binary neutron star merger emitting gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves, GW170817/GRB 170817A. The distance to this galaxy is not well established. We select the globular cluster candidates from the Hubble Space Telescope/ACS F606W images of NGC 4993 in the archive, using the structural parameters of the detected sources.  Also the luminosity function of these candidates is fit well by a Gaussian function. We derive an extinction-corrected turnover Vega magnitude in the luminosity function of the globular clusters we derive a distance to NGC 4993, d = 41.65 plus minus 3.00 Mpc. The systematic error of this method can be as large as  0.3 mag. This value is consistent with the previous distance estimates based on the fundamental plane relation and the gravitational wave method in the literature. The distance in this study can be used to constrain the values of the parameters including the inclination angle of the binary system in the models of gravitational wave analysis.

Our simulations largely vindicate formulae for ejecta properties but do not find the expected dependence of disk mass on neutron star compaction. We track the early evolution of the accretion disk, largely driven by shocking and fallback inflow, and do find notable equation of state effects on the structure of this early-time, neutrino-bright disk.

title: Numerical simulations of the jet dynamics and synchrotron radiation of binary neutron star merger event GW170817/GRB170817A
authors: Xiaoyi Xie, Jonathan Zrake, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We present numerical simulations of energetic flows propagating through the debris cloud of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. Starting from the scale of the central engine, we use a moving-mesh hydrodynamics code to simulate the complete dynamical evolution of the produced relativistic jets. We compute synchrotron emission directly from the simulations and present multi-band light curves of the early (sub-day) through late (weeks to years) afterglow stages. Our work systematically compares two distinct models for the central engine, referred to as the narrow and wide engine scenario, which is associated with a successful structured jet and a quasi-isotropic explosion respectively. The rapidly declining signature may be detectable for future BNS mergers during the first minutes to day following the GW chirp. Furthermore, its non-detection for the GRB170817A event may disfavor the wide, quasi-isotropic explosion model.

topic: We use gravitational-wave observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 to explore the tidal deformabilities and radii of neutron stars. We perform Bayesian parameter estimation with the source location and distance informed by electromagnetic observations. We also assume that the two stars have the same equation of state; we demonstrate that for stars with masses comparable to the component masses of GW170817, this is effectively implemented by assuming that the stars' dimensionless tidal deformabilities are determined by the binary's mass ratio. Our results are the first measurement of tidal deformability with a physical constraint on the star's equation of state and place the first lower bounds on the deformability and areal radii of neutron stars using gravitational waves.

title: What Powered the Optical Transient AT2017gfo Associated with GW170817?
authors: Shao-Ze Li, Liang-Duan Liu, Yun-Wei Yu, Bing Zhang
topic: The groundbreaking discovery of the optical transient AT2017gfo associated with GW170817 opens a unique opportunity to study the physics of double neutron star (NS) mergers. We argue that the standard interpretation of AT2017gfo as being powered by radioactive decays of r-process elements faces the challenge of simultaneously accounting for the peak luminosity and peak time of the event, as it is not easy to achieve the required high mass, and especially the low opacity of the ejecta required to fit the data. We consider energy injection from two types of the merger products: (1) a post-merger black hole powered by fallback accretion; and (2) a long-lived NS remnant. In the latter case, both early- and late-emission components can be well interpreted as due to energy injection from a spinning-down NS, with the required mass and opacity of the ejecta components well consistent with known numerical simulation results. We suggest that there is a strong indication that the merger product of GW170817 is a long-lived (supramassive or even permanently stable), low magnetic field NS. The result provides a stringent constraint on the equations of state of NSs.

title: Measuring the viewing angle of GW170817 with electromagnetic and gravitational waves
authors: Daniel Finstad, Soumi De, Duncan A. Brown, Edo Berger, Christopher M. Biwer
topic: Here, we use joint GW-EM observations to measure the viewing angle of GW170817, the angle between the binary's angular momentum and the line of sight. We combine a direct measurement of the distance to the host galaxy of GW170817 (NGC 4993) of 40.7\pm2.36 Mpc with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)/Virgo GW data and find that the viewing angle is 32+10−13\pm1.7 degrees (90\% confidence, statistical, and systematic errors). We place a conservative lower limit on the viewing angle of more then 13\deg, which is robust to the choice of prior. This measurement provides a constraint on models of the prompt \gamma-ray and radio/X-ray afterglow emission associated with the merger; for example, it is consistent with the off-axis viewing angle inferred for a structured jet model.

title: Production of Mo and Ru isotopes in neutrino-driven winds: implications for solar abundances and presolar grains
authors: Julia Bliss, Almudena Arcones, Yong-Zhong Qian
topic: The origin of the so-called p-isotopes 92,94[Mo] and 96,98[Ru] in the solar system remains a mystery as several astrophysical scenarios fail to account for them. In addition, data on presolar silicon carbide grains of type X (SiC X) exhibit peculiar Mo patterns, especially for 95,97[Mo]. We examine production of Mo and Ru isotopes in neutrino-driven winds associated with core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) over a wide range of conditions. We find that proton-rich winds can make dominant contributions to the solar abundance of 98[Ru], significant contributions to those of 96[Ru] (less 40%) and 92Mo (less 27%), and relatively minor contributions to that of 94[Mo] (less 14%). In contrast, neutron-rich winds make negligible contributions to the solar abundances of 92,94[Mo] and cannot produce 96,98[Ru]. However, we show that some neutron-rich winds can account for the peculiar Mo patterns in SiC X grains. Our results can be generalized if conditions similar to those studied here are also obtained for other types of ejecta in either CCSNe or neutron star mergers.

title: Short gamma-ray burst central engines
authors: Riccardo Ciolfi
topic: Growing evidence connects the progenitor systems of the short-hard subclass of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to the merger of compact object binaries composed by two neutron stars (NSs) or by a NS and a black hole (BH). However, the mechanisms through which a BNS or NS-BH merger remnant would power a collimated outflow are much less constrained. Understanding the properties of the remnant systems and whether they can provide the right conditions for jet production has been a main driver of the great effort devoted to study BNS and NS-BH mergers, and still represents a real challenge from both the physical and the computational point of view. One fundamental open question concerns the nature of the central engine itself. Here we elaborate on this key aspect, considering three different scenarios to explain the SGRB phenomenology based on different hypotheses on the nature of the merger remnant. Then, we discuss the basic properties of GRB 170817A and how this event would fit within the different frameworks of the above scenarios, under the assumption that it was or was not a canonical SGRB.

topic: However, observations of metal-poor stars with highly-enhanced r-process elements have revealed abundance patterns suggesting that multiple sites may be involved. To address this issue, and to advance our understanding of the r-process, we have initiated an extensive search for bright (V lenss 13.5), very metal-poor ([Fe/H] less then 2) stars in the Milky Way halo exhibiting strongly-enhanced r-process signatures. This paper presents the first sample collected in the Southern Hemisphere, using the echelle spectrograph on du Pont 2.5m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Of those, 12 stars are strongly enhanced in heavy r-process elements (r-II), 42 stars show moderate enhancements of heavy r-process material (r-I), and 20 stars exhibit low abundances of the heavy r-process elements and higher abundances of the light r-process elements relative to the heavy ones (limited-r). This search is more successful at finding r-process-enhanced stars compared to previous searches, primarily due to a refined target selection procedure that focuses on red giants.

authors: G. Fiorella Burgio, Anthea F. Fantina
topic:  We review the current status of the EoS for compact objects, that have been studied with both ab-initio many-body approaches and phenomenological models. We limit ourselves to the description of EoSs with purely nucleonic degrees of freedom, disregarding the appearance of strange baryonic matter and/or quark matter. We compare the theoretical predictions with different data coming from both nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations. Combining the complementary information thus obtained greatly enriches our insights into the dense nuclear matter properties. Current challenges in the description of the EoS are also discussed, mainly focusing on the model dependence of the constraints extracted from either experimental or observational data (specifically, concerning the symmetry energy), the lack of a consistent and rigorous many-body treatment at zero and finite temperature of the matter encountered in compact stars (e.g. problem of cluster formation and extension of the EoS to very high temperatures), the role of nucleonic three-body forces, and the dependence of the direct URCA processes on the EoS.

title: The demographics of neutron star - white dwarf mergers: rates, delay-time distributions and progenitors
authors: S. Toonen, H.B. Perets, A.P. Igoshev, E. Michaely, Y. Zenati
topic: The mergers of neutron stars (NSs) and white dwarfs (WDs) could give rise to explosive transients, potentially observable with current and future transient surveys. However, the expected properties and distribution of such events is not well understood. Here we characterize the rates of such events, their delay time distribution, their progenitors and the distribution of their properties. We use binary populations synthesis models and consider a wide range of initial conditions and physical processes. We find that the majority of NS-WD mergers are born in systems in which mass-transfer played an important role, and the WD formed before the NS. For the majority of the mergers the WDs have a carbon-oxygen composition (60-80%) and most of the rest are with oxygen-neon WDs. The rates of NS-WD mergers are in the range of 3-15% of the type Ia supernovae (SNe) rate. Their delay time distribution is very similar to that of type Ia SNe, but slightly biased towards earlier times. They typically explode in young 0.1-1Gyr environments, but have a tail distribution extending to long, Gyrs-timescales.

title: Shock acceleration of electrons and synchrotron emission from the dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers
authors: Shiu-Hang Lee, Keiichi Maeda, Norita Kawanaka
topic: As analogous to supernovae and supernova remnants, the NSM dynamical ejecta are expected to produce non-thermal emission by electrons accelerated at a shock wave. In this paper, we present expected radio and X-ray signals by this mechanism, taking into account non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and magnetic field amplification. We suggest that the NSM has a unique nature as a DSA site, where the seed relativistic electrons are abundantly provided by the decays of r-process elements. The signal is predicted to peak at a few 100 - 1,000 days after the merger, determined by the balance between the decrease of the number of seed electrons and the increase of the dissipated kinetic energy due to the shock expansion. While the resulting flux can ideally reach to the maximum flux expected from near-equipartition, the available kinetic energy dissipation rate of the NSM ejecta limits the detectability of such a signal. It is likely that the radio and X-ray emission are overwhelmed by other mechanisms (e.g., an off-axis jet) for an observer placed to a jet direction (i.e., for GW170817). On the other hand, for an off-axis observer, to be discovered once a number of NSMs are identified, the dynamical ejecta component is predicted to dominate the non-thermal emission. While the detection of this signal is challenging even with near-future facilities, this potentially provides a robust probe of the creation of r-process elements in NSMs.

title: Long-lived Remnants from Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: David Radice, Albino Perego, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Bing Zhang
topic: We find that gravitational-wave (GW) emission is not able to remove this excess angular momentum within the time over which solid body rotation should be achieved. Instead, we argue that the excess angular momentum could be carried away by massive winds. Long-lived merger remnants are also formed with larger gravitational masses than those of rigidly-rotating NSs having the same number of baryons. The excess mass is likely radiated in the form of neutrinos. The evolution of long-lived remnants on the viscous timescale is thus determined by the interplay of finite-temperature effects, mass ejection, and neutrinos with potentially dramatic consequences for the remnants' properties and stability. We also provide an empirical fit for the spin of the remnant at the end of its viscous evolution as a function of its final mass, and we discuss the implications for the magnetar model of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Finally, we investigate the possible electromagnetic signatures associated with the viscous ejecta. Massive outflows possibly resulting from the formation of long-lived remnants would power unusually bright, blue kilonova counterparts to GW events and SGRBs whose detection would provide smoking gun evidence for the formation of long-lived remnants.

title: Central Engine-Powered Bright X-ray Flares in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts: A Hint of Black Hole-Neutron Star Merger?
authors: Hui-Jun Mu, Wei-Min Gu, Jirong Mao, Shu-Jin Hou, Da-Bin Lin, Tong Liu
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts may originate from the merger of double neutron stars (NS) or that of a black hole (BH) and an NS. We propose that the bright X-ray flare related to the central engine reactivity may hint a BH-NS merger, since such a merger can provide more fall-back materials and therefore a more massive accretion disk than the NS-NS merger. Based on the observed 49 short bursts with Swift/X-ray Telescope follow-up observations, we find that three bursts have bright X-ray flares, among which three flares from two bursts are probably related to the central engine reactivity. We argue that these two bursts may originate from the BH-NS merger rather than the NS-NS merger. Our suggested link between the central engine-powered bright X-ray flare and the BH-NS merger event can be checked by the future gravitational wave detections from advanced LIGO and Virgo.

title: Bimodal distribution of short gamma-ray bursts: evidence for two distinct types of short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Y. B. Yu, L. B. Li, B. Li, J. J. Geng, Y. F. Huang
topic: Recently, GRB 170817A was confirmed to be associated with GW 170817, which was produced by a neutron star - neutron star merger. It indicates that at least some short gamma-ray bursts come from binary neutron star mergers. Theoretically, it is widely accepted that short gamma-ray bursts can be produced by two distinctly different mechanisms, binary neutron star mergers and neutron star - black hole mergers. These two kinds of bursts should be different observationally due to their different trigger mechanisms. Motivated by this idea, we collect a universal data set constituted of 51 short gamma-ray bursts observed by Swift/BAT, among which 14 events have extended emission component. We study the observational features of these 51 events statistically. It is found that our samples are consisted of two distinct groups. They clearly show a bimodal distribution when their peak photon fluxes at 15-150 keV band are plotted against the corresponding fluences. Most interestingly, all the 14 short bursts with extended emission lie in a particular region

We use recent calculations of the conductivities of warm correlated plasma in envelopes of compact stars and find that the magnetic-field decay timescales are much larger than the characteristic timescales of the merger process for lengthscales down to a meter. Because these are smaller than the currently available resolution in numerical simulations, the ideal-magnetohydrodynamics approximation is effectively valid for all realistic simulations. At the same time, we find that the Hall effect can be important at low densities and low temperatures, where it can induce a non-dissipative rearrangement of the magnetic field. Finally, we mark the region in temperature and density where the hydrodynamic description breaks down.

title: High-resolution numerical relativity simulations of spinning binary neutron star mergers
authors: Tim Dietrich, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Bernd Bruegmann, Wolfgang Tichy
topic: Numerical relativity simulations are the only tool to describe the binary's merger dynamics in the regime when speeds are largest and gravity is strongest. In this work we report state-of-the-art binary neutron star simulations for irrotational (non-spinning) and spinning configurations. The main use of these simulations is to model the gravitational-wave signal. Key numerical requirements are the understanding of the convergence properties of the numerical data and a detailed error budget. The simulations have been performed on different HPC clusters, they use multiple grid resolutions, and are based on eccentricity reduced quasi-circular initial data. We obtain convergent waveforms with phase errors of 0.5-1.5 rad accumulated over approximately 12 orbits to merger. The waveforms have been used for the construction of a phenomenological waveform model which has been applied for the analysis of the recent binary neutron star detection. Additionally, we show that the data can also be used to test other state-of-the-art semi-analytical waveform models.

title: Gamma Ray Bursts. Progenitors, accretion in the central engine, jet acceleration mechanisms
authors: Agnieszka Janiuk, Kostas Sapountzis 
topic: The collapsar model was proposed to explain the long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), while the short GRBs are associated with the mergers of compact objects. In the first case, mainly the energetics of the events is consistent with the proposed progenitor models, while the duration, time variability, as well as the afterglow emission may shed some light on the detailed properties of the collapsing massive stars.  For long ones, the rotation of the progenitor star is a key property in order to support accretion over relatively long activity periods, and also to sustain the rotation of the black hole itself. The latter is responsible for ejection of the relativistic jets, which are powered due to the extraction of the BH rotational energy, mitigated by the accretion torus and magnetic fields. The jets must break through the stellar envelope though, which poses a question on the efficiency of this process. Similar mechanisms of powering the jet ejection may act in short GRBs, which in this case may freely propagate through the interstellar medium. The power of the jets launched from the rotating black hole is at first associated mostly with the magnetic Poynting flux, and then at large distances it is transferred to the kinetic and finally radiative energy of the expanding shells.

title: Tidal deformability from GW170817 as a direct probe of the neutron star radius
authors: Carolyn Raithel, Feryal Özel, Dimitrios Psaltis
topic: We report here on a new simplification that arises in the effective tidal deformability of the binary, when the chirp mass is specified. We find that, in this case, the effective tidal deformability of the binary is surprisingly independent of the component masses of the individual neutron stars, and instead depends primarily on the ratio of the chirp mass to the neutron star radius. Thus, a measurement of the effective tidal deformability can be used to directly measure the neutron star radius. We find that the upper limit on the effective tidal deformability from GW170817 implies that the radius cannot be larger than \sim 13km, at the 90\% level, independent of the assumed masses for the component stars. The result can be applied generally, to probe the stellar radii in any neutron star-neutron star merger with a measured chirp mass

title: From gamma to Radio - The Electromagnetic Counterpart of GW 170817
authors: Ehud Nakar, Ore Gottlieb, Tsvi Piran, Mansi M. Kasliwal, Greg Hallinan 
topic: However, a closer examination of the sub-luminous γ-rays and the peculiar radio afterglow were inconsistent with this simple interpretation. Here we present results of 3D and 2D numerical simulations that follow the hydrodynamics and emission of the outflow from a neutron star merger form its ejection and up to its deceleration by the circum-merger medium. Our results show that the entire set of \gamma -rays, X-rays and radio observations can be explained by the emission from a mildly relativistic cocoon material (Lorentz factor \sim 2-5) that was formed while a jet propagated through the material ejected during the merger. The γ-rays are generated when the cocoon breaks out from the engulfing ejecta while the afterglow is produced by interaction of the cocoon matter with the interstellar medium. The strong early uv/optical signal may be a Lorentz boosted macronova/kilonova. The fate of the jet itself is currently unknown, but our full-EM models define a path to resolving between successful and choked jet scenarios, outputting coupled predictions for the image size, morphology, observed time-dependent polarization and light curve behavior from radio to X-ray. The predictive power of these models will prove key in interpreting the on-going multi-faceted observations of this unprecedented event.

title: Brightening X-ray/Optical/Radio Emission of GW170817/SGRB 170817A: Results of an Electron-Positron Wind from the Central Engine?
authors: Jin-Jun Geng, Zi-Gao Dai, Yong-Feng Huang, Xue-Feng Wu, Long-Biao Li, Bing Li, Yan-Zhi Meng
topic: Recent follow-up observations of the binary neutron star (NS) merging event GW170817/SGRB 170817A reveal that its X-ray/optical/radio emissions are brightening continuously up to \sim 100 days post-merger. This late-time brightening is unexpected from the kilonova model or the off-axis top-hat jet model for gamma-ray burst afterglows. In this paper, by assuming that the merger remnant is a long-lived NS, we propose that the interaction between an electron-positron-pair (e+e−) wind from the central NS and the jet could produce a long-lived reverse shock, from which a new emission component would rise and can interpret current observations well. We suggest that radio polarization observations of the brightening would help to distinguish our scenario from other scenarios. Future observations on a large sample of short gamma-ray burst afterglows or detections of GW signals from merger remnants would test our scenario.

authors: Dougal Dobie, David L. Kaplan, Tara Murphy, Emil Lenc, Kunal P. Mooley, Christene Lynch, Alessandra Corsi, Dale Frail, Mansi Kasliwal, Gregg Hallinan
topic: We present 2-9 GHz radio observations of GW170817 covering the period 125-200 days post-merger, taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Our observations demonstrate that the radio afterglow peaked at 149±2 days post-merger and is now declining in flux density. We see no evidence for evolution in the radio-only spectral index, which remains consistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission connecting the radio, optical, and X-ray regimes. The peak implies a total energy in the synchrotron-emitting component of a few 10^50 ergs . The temporal decay rate is most consistent with mildly- or non-relativistic material and we do not see evidence for a very energetic off-axis jet, but we cannot distinguish between a lower-energy jet and more isotropic emission.

title: Xiao-Feng Cao, Yun-Wei Yu, Xia Zhou
authors: 
topic: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are usually suggested to be associated with mergers of compact binaries consisting of white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs), or black holes (BHs). We test these models by fitting the observational distributions in both redshift and isotropic energy of 22 Parkes FRBs, where, as usual, the rates of compact binary mergers (CBMs) are connected with cosmic star formation rates by a power-law distributed time delay. It is found that the observational distributions can well be produced by the CBM model with a characteristic delay time from several ten to several hundred Myr and an energy function index gamma 1.2 - 1.7 where a tentative fixed spectral index beta 0.8 is adopted for all FRBs.  This event rate, about an order of magnitude higher than the rates of NS-NS/NS-BH mergers, indicates that the most promising origin of FRBs in the CBM scenario could be mergers of WD-WD binaries. Here a massive WD could be produced since no FRB was found to be associated with a type Ia supernova. Alternatively, if actually all FRBs can repeat on a timescale much longer than the period of current observations, then they could also originate from a young active NS that forms from relatively rare NS-NS mergers and accretion-induced collapses of WD-WD binaries.

title: Off-axis afterglow light curves and images from 2D hydrodynamic simulations of double-sided GRB jets in a stratified external medium
authors: Jonathan Granot, Fabio De Colle, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
topic: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets are narrow, and thus typically point away from us. They are initially ultra-relativistic, causing their prompt γ-ray and early afterglow emission to be beamed away from us. However, as the jet gradually decelerates its beaming cone widens and eventually reaches our line of sight and the afterglow emission may be detected. Such orphan afterglows were not clearly detected so far. Nevertheless, they should be detected in upcoming optical or radio surveys, and it would be challenging to clearly distinguish between them and other types of transients. Therefore, we perform detailed, realistic calculations of the expected afterglow emission from GRB jets viewed at different angles from the jet's symmetry axis. The dynamics are calculated using 2D relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of jets propagating into different power-law external density profiles. ranging from a uniform ISM-like medium . to a stratified steady stellar-wind like profile k =2.  We calculate radio, optical and X-ray lightcurves, and the evolution of the radio afterglow image size, shape and flux centroid. This may help identify misaligned relativistic jets, whether initially ultra-relativistic and producing a GRB for observers within their beam, or (possibly intrinsically more common) moderately relativistic, in either (i) nearby supernovae Ib/c (some of which are associated with long duration GRBs), or (ii) in binary neutron star mergers, which may produce short duration GRBs, and may also be detected in gravitational waves (e.g. GW170827/GRB170817A with a weak prompt γ-ray emission may harbor an off-axis jet).

title: Light curves of a shock-breakout material and a relativistic off-axis jet from a Binary Neutron Star system
authors: N. Fraija, A.C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira, P. Veres
topic: Binary neutron star mergers are believed to eject significant masses with a diverse range of velocities. Once these ejected materials begin to be decelerated by a homogeneous medium, relativistic electrons are mainly cooled down by synchrotron radiation, generating a multiwavelength long-lived afterglow. Analytic and numerical methods illustrate that the outermost matter, the merger shock-breakout material, can be parametrized by power-law velocity distributions [func]. Considering that the shock-breakout material is moving on-axis towards the observer and the relativistic jet off-axis, we compute the light curves during the relativistic and the lateral expansion phase. As a particular case, we successfully describe the X-ray, optical and radio light curves alongside the spectral energy distribution from the recently discovered gravitational-wave transient GW170817, when the merger shock-breakout material moves with mildly relativistic velocities near-Newtonian phase and the jet with relativistic velocities. Future electromagnetic counterpart observations of this binary system could be able to evaluate different properties of these light curves.

Such temperatures are attained in neutron star mergers. By numerically computing the relevant weak interaction rates we find that the correct criterion for beta equilibrium requires an isospin chemical potential that can be as large as 10-20 MeV, depending on the temperature at which neutrinos become trapped.

title: Synchrotron radiation from the fast tail of dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers
authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Kenta Kiuchi, Masaru Shibata, Ehud Nakar, Tsvi Piran 
topic: We find, using high resolution numerical relativistic simulations, that the tail of the dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers extends to mildly relativistic velocities faster than 0.7c. The kinetic energy of this fast tail is depending on the neutron star equation of state and on the binary masses. The synchrotron flare arising from the interaction of this fast tail with the surrounding ISM can power the observed non-thermal emission that followed GW170817, provided that the ISM density 10^-2 the two neutron stars had roughly equal masses and the neutron star equation of state is soft (small neutron star radii). One of the generic predictions of this scenario is that the cooling frequency crosses the X-ray band on a time scale of a few months to a year, leading to a cooling break in the X-ray light curve. If this dynamical ejecta scenario is correct, we expect that the synchrotron radio flare from the ejecta that have produced the macronova/kilonova emission will be observable on time scales of 10^3 10^5 days

title: Continued Brightening of the Afterglow of GW170817/GRB 170817A as due to a Delayed Energy Injection
authors: Bing Li, Long-Biao Li, Yong-Feng Huang, Jin-Jun Geng, Yong-Bo Yu, Li-Ming Song
topic: The brightness of the multi-wavelength afterglow of GRB 170817A is increasing unexpectedly even approx 160 days after the associated gravitational burst. Here we suggest that the brightening can be caused by a late-time energy injection process. We use an empirical expression to mimic the evolution of the injection luminosity, which is consisted of a power-law rising phase and a power-law decreasing phase. It is found that the power-law indices of the two phases are 0.92 and −2.8, respectively, with the peak time of the injection being approx 110 days. The energy injection could be due to some kind of accretion, with the total accreted mass being \approx 0.006Msun. However, normal fall-back accretion, which usually lasts for a much shorter period, cannot provide a natural explanation. we argue that there should also be some ejecta with correspondingly lower velocities during the coalescence of the double neutron star system. They are bound by the gravitational well of the remnant central compact object and might be accreted at a timescale of about 100 days, providing a reasonable explanation for the energy injection. Detailed studies on the long-lasting brightening of GRB 170817A thus may provide useful information on the matter ejection during the merger process of binary neutron stars.

topic: (NS-NS) merger. In order to probe this association we confront our current understanding of the gravitational waves and associated electromagnetic radiation with four observed GRBs originating in binaries composed of different combinations NSs and white dwarfs (WDs). We consider 1) GRB 090510 the prototype of NS-NS merger leading to a black hole (BH); 2) GRB 130603B the prototype of a NS-NS merger leading to massive NS (MNS) with an associated kilonova; 3) GRB 060614 the prototype of a NS-WD merger leading to a MNS with an associated kilonova candidate; 4) GRB 170817A the prototype of a WD-WD merger leading to massive WD with an associated AT 2017gfo-like emission. None of these systems support the above mentioned association. The clear association between GRB 170817A and AT 2017gfo has led to introduce a new model based on on a new subfamily of GRBs originating from WD-WD mergers.

title: Effects of Fall-Back Accretion on Proto-Magnetar Outflows in Gamma-Ray Bursts and Superluminous Supernovae
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Paz Beniamini, Dimitrios Giannios
topic: Rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars ("millisecond proto-magnetars") are candidate central engines of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRB), superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), and binary neutron star mergers. The more complex evolution of the jet power and magnetization of an accreting magnetar more readily accounts for the high 56Ni yields GRB SNe and irregular time evolution of some GRB light curves (e.g.~bursts with precursors followed by a long quiescent interval before the main emission episode). Additional baryon-loading from accretion-powered neutrino irradiation of the magnetar polar cap lengthens the timeframe over which the jet magnetization is in the requisite range sigma less of equal 1e3 for efficient gamma-ray emission, thereby accommodating GRBs with ultra-long durations.

title: Is the macronova in GW170817 powered by the central engine?
authors: Tatsuya Matsumoto, Kunihito Ioka, Shota Kisaka, Ehud Nakar
topic:  Although the radioactivity of synthesized r-process elements is widely discussed as an energy source, its decisive evidence is not clearly shown yet. We discuss a macronova powered by the central engine activities such as jet activities and X-rays from the matter fallback, and show that the engine model allows much broader parameter spaces, in particular smaller ejecta mass 1e-4-0.01Msun than the r-process model. The blue and red macronovae are naturally explained by various combinations of the ejecta such as a cocoon and merger ejecta with the energy sources of jets and X-rays. The required energy injection is very similar to the X-ray excess observed in GRB 130603B with the power-law slope of \sim 1.3 The required lanthanoid fraction for the opacity can be also consistent with the Galactic one

topic: It has recently become clear that in both short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) it coexists a sequence of different events, each characterized by specific physical processes and corresponding values of the Lorentz gamma factors. The ultra-relativistic prompt emission (UPE) phase, with Lorentz factor less Gamma=1e4 is followed by a mildly relativistic plateau-afterglow phase with Gamma=2 The GeV radiation, with Gamma approx 50  coexists with the above two phases. It is shown that: a) the GeV radiation originates at the onset of the formation of a black hole (BH), b) its luminosity follows specific power-law dependence when measured in the rest frame of the source with a decay index gamma = -1.29 \mp 0.06. We present these conceptual results for the case of short GRBs in this article and give the extended analysis for long GRBs in a companion article. A direct astrophysical application of these results is that the merger of binary neutron stars leading to BH formation emits GeV radiation: the GeV emission is a necessary and sufficient condition to indicate the creation of a BH in S-GRBs.

topic:  We find that photospheric models (both dissipative and non-dissipative variants) have difficulties accounting for the observations. Internal shocks give the most natural account of the observed peak energy, viewing angle and total energy. We also show that a simple external shock model can reproduce the observed GRB pulse with parameters consistent with those derived from the afterglow modeling. We find a simple cocoon shock breakout model is in mild tension with the observed spectral evolution, however it cannot be excluded based on gamma-ray data alone. Future joint observations of brighter GRBs will pose even tighter constraints on prompt emission models.

title: From actinides to zinc: Using the full abundance pattern of the brightest star in Reticulum II to distinguish between different r-process sites
authors: Alexander P. Ji, Anna Frebel
topic: The observed neutron-capture element abundances closely match the solar r-process component, except for the first r-process peak which is significantly lower than solar but matches other r-process enhanced stars. The ratio of first peak to heavier r-process elements implies the r-process site produces roughly equal masses of high and low electron fraction ejecta, within a factor of 2. We compare the detailed abundance pattern to predictions from nucleosynthesis calculations of neutron star mergers and magneto-rotationally driven jet supernovae, finding that nuclear physics uncertainties dominate over astrophysical uncertainties. The abundance of light elements up to Zn are consistent with extremely metal-poor Milky Way halo stars. They may eventually provide a way to distinguish between neutron star mergers and magneto-rotationally driven jet supernovae, but this would require more detailed knowledge of the chemical evolution of Reticulum II.

We find a region of the chart of nuclides where the probability of \beta-delayed fission is \approx 100%, that likely prevents the production of superheavy elements in nature. We explore the impact of \beta-delayed fission in rapid neutron capture process (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the tidal ejecta of a neutron star--neutron star merger and show that it is a key fission channel that shapes the final abundances near the second r-process peak.

authors: Roberto De Pietri, Alessandra Feo, José A. Font, Frank Löffler, Francesco Maione, Michele Pasquali, Nikolaos Stergioulas
topic: We present the first very long-term simulations (extending up to ~140 ms after merger) of binary neutron star mergers with piecewise polytropic equations of state and in full general relativity. Our simulations reveal that at a time of 30-50 ms after merger, parts of the star become convectively unstable, which triggers the excitation of inertial modes. The excited inertial modes are sustained up to several tens of milliseconds and are potentially observable by the planned third-generation gravitational-wave detectors at frequencies of a few kilohertz. Since inertial modes depend on the rotation rate of the star and they are triggered by a convective instability in the postmerger remnant, their detection in gravitational waves will provide a unique opportunity to probe the rotational and thermal state of the merger remnant. In addition, our findings have implications for the long-term evolution and stability of binary neutron star remnants

authors: K. Sapountzis, A. Janiuk
topic: Short gamma ray bursts are presumably results of binary neutron star mergers, which lead to the formation of a stellar mass black hole, surrounded by a remnant matter. The strong magnetic fields help collimate jets of plasma, launched along the axis of the black hole rotation. We study the structure and evolution of the accreting plasma in the short GRBs and we model the formation of the base of a relativistic, Poynting-dominated jets. Our numerical models are based on the general relativistic MHD, axisymmetric simulations. We discuss the origin of variability in the GRB jet emission, which timescales are related to the action of the magneto-rotational instability in the accreting plasma. We also estimate the value of a maximum achievable Lorentz factor in the jets produced by our simulations, and reached at the large distances, where the gamma ray emission is produced.

authors: Iair Arcavi
topic: The combined optical data show an early rise consistent with radioactive decay of low opacity ejecta as the main emission source, but the subsequent decline is fit well by all models. A lack of constraints on the ultraviolet flux during the first few hours after discovery allows for both radioactive decay and other cooling mechanisms to explain the early bolometric light curve. This analysis demonstrates that early (few hours after merger) high-cadence optical and ultraviolet observations will be critical for determining the source of blue emission in future kilonovae.

title: Inverse compton scattered merger-nova: late X-ray counterpart of gravitational wave signals from NS-NS/BH mergers
authors: Shunke Ai, He Gao
topic:  The central remnant could launch a collimated jet and when the jet propagating through the ejecta, a mildly relativistic cocoon would be formed and the interaction between the cocoon and the ambient medium would accelerate electrons via external shock in a wide angle. So that the merger-nova photons (i.e., thermal emission from the ejecta) would be scattered into higher frequency via inverse compton (IC) process when they propagating through the cocoon shocked region. We find that the IC scattered component peaks at X-ray band and it will reach its peak luminosity in order of days (simultaneously with the merger-nova emission). With current X-ray detectors, such a late X-ray component could be detected out to 200 Mpc, depending on the merger remnant properties. It could serve as an important electromagnetic counterpart of gravitational wave signals from NS-NS/BH mergers.

topic: Considering the relatively large total mass, it is generally proposed that the merger of GW170817 would lead to a shortly lived hypermassive NS or directly produce a black hole (BH). There is no clear evidence to support or rule out a long-lived NS as the merger remnant. Here we utilize the GW and electromagnetic (EM) signals to comprehensively investigate the parameter space that allows a long-lived NS to survive as the merger remnant of GW170817. We find that for some stiff equations of state, the merger of GW170817 could, in principle, lead to a massive NS, which has a millisecond spin period. The post-merger GW signal could hardly constrain the ellipticity of the NS

title: Compton echoes from nearby Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Paz Beniamini, Dimitrios Giannios, George Younes, Alexander J. van der Horst, Chryssa Kouveliotou
topic: We consider here Compton echoes, the scattered light from the prompt and afterglow emission. Compton echoes, an as yet undetected counterpart of GRBs, peak in X-rays and maintain a roughly constant flux for hundreds to thousands of years after the burst. Though too faint to be detected in typical cosmological GRBs, a fraction of close by bursts with a sufficiently large energy output in X-rays, and for which the surrounding medium is sufficiently dense, may indeed be observed in this way. The detection of a Compton echo could provide unique insight into the burst properties and the environment's density structure. In particular, it could potentially determine whether or not there was a successful jet that broke through the compact binary merger ejecta. We discuss here the properties and expectations from Compton echoes and suggest methods for detectability.

title: Compact binary merger and kilonova: outflows from remnant disc
authors: Tuan Yi, Wei-Min Gu, Tong Liu, Rajiv Kumar, Hui-Jun Mu, Cui-Ying Song
topic: Outflows launched from a remnant disc of compact binary merger may have essential contribution to the kilonova emission. Numerical calculations are conducted in this work to study the structure of accretion flows and outflows. By the incorporation of limited-energy advection in the hyper-accretion discs, outflows occur naturally from accretion flows due to imbalance between the viscous heating and the sum of the advective and radiative cooling. Following this spirit, we revisit the properties of the merger outflow ejecta. Our results show that around of the disc mass can be launched as powerful outflows. The amount of unbound mass varies with the disc mass and the viscosity. The outflow-contributed peak luminosity is around.

title: Implications of the radio and X-ray emission that followed GW170817
authors: Ehud Nakar, Tsvi Piran
topic: The radio and X-rays that followed GW170817 increased gradually over similar  100 days, resembling the radio flare predicted to arise from the interaction of a binary neutron star merger outflow with the ISM \citep{nakar2011}. Considering a blast wave moving with a Lorentz factor Gamma, we show that an off-axis observer, namely an observer at. Observations imply that at all times we have seen an on-axis emission. The isotropic equivalent energy in the observed region increases with time,  implying that the outflow was structured. The energy increase can arise from a slower material moving behind the blast wave or from a matter moving at larger angles that has slowed down. Such a structure could have different origins, however, the only physically motivated one, proposed so far, is the interaction of a relativistic jet with the ejecta and the resulting cocoon. The jet could have been choked or successful. In the latter case, it has produced a short GRB pointing elsewhere (this successful jet-cocoon system is sometimes called a "structured jet")

topic: A high-resolution spectroscopic analysis is presented for a new highly r-process-enhanced very metal-poor retrograde halo star, RAVE J153830.9-180424, discovered as part of the R-Process Alliance survey. J1538-1804's r-process pattern matches that of the Sun for elements between the first, second, and third peaks, and does not exhibit an actinide boost. Cosmo-chronometric age-dating reveals the r-process material to be quite old. This robust main r-process pattern is a necessary constraint for r-process formation scenarios (of particular interest in light of the recent neutron star merger, GW 170817), and has important consequences for the origins of r-II stars. Additional r-I and r-II stars will be reported by the R-Process Alliance in the near future.

title: Uncertainties in radiative neutron-capture rates relevant to the A similar 80 r-process peak
authors: I. K. B. Kullmann, E. W. Hafli, A.C. Larsen, E. Lima
topic: The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) has for the first time been confirmed to take place in a neutron-star merger event. A detailed understanding of the rapid neutron-capture process is one of the holy grails in nuclear astrophysics. In this work we investigate one aspect of the r-process modelling: uncertainties in radiative neutron-capture cross sections and astrophysical reaction rates for isotopes of the elements Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, and Se. In particular, we study deviations from standard libraries used for astrophysics, and the influence of a very-low γ-energy enhancement in the average, reduced γ-decay probability on the (n,γ) rates. We find that the intrinsic uncertainties are in some cases extremely large, and that the low-energy enhancement, if present in neutron-rich nuclei, may increase the neutron-capture reaction rate significantly.

authors: E. Troja, L. Piro, G. Ryan, H. van Eerten, R. Ricci, M. H. Wieringa, S. Lotti, T. Sakamoto, S. B. Cenko
topic: We present our broadband study of GW170817 from radio to hard X-rays, including NuSTAR and Chandra observations up to 165 days after the merger, and a multi-messenger analysis including LIGO constraints. The data are compared with predictions from a wide range of models, providing the first detailed comparison between non-trivial cocoon and jet models. Homogeneous and power-law shaped jets, as well as simple cocoon models are ruled out by the data, while both a Gaussian shaped jet and a cocoon with energy injection can describe the current dataset for a reasonable range of physical parameters, consistent with the typical values derived from short GRB afterglows. We propose that these models can be unambiguously discriminated by future observations measuring the post-peak behaviour, with slope -1.0 for the cocoon and -2.5 for the jet model.

topic: We report our observation of the short GRB 170817A, associated to the binary neutron star merger event GW 170817, perfomed in the X-ray band with XMM-Newton 135 d after the event (on the 29th December 2017). We find evidence for a flattening of the X-ray light curve with respect to the previously observed brightening. We interpret all the existing afterglow data with two models: i) a structured jet and ii) a jet-less isotropic fireball with some stratification in its radial velocity structure. Both models fit the data and predict that the radio flux must decrease simultaneously with the optical and the X-ray one, making hard to distinguish between them at the present stage. Polarimetric measures and the rate of short GRB-GW association in future LIGO/Virgo runs will be key to disentangle these two geometrically different scenarios.

title: Prompt gamma-ray emission of GRB 170817A associated to GW 170817: A consistent picture
authors: Houri Ziaeepour
topic: Here we use a phenomenological model of shock evolution and synchrotron/self-Compton emission to simulate the prompt emission of GRB 170817A and to test above proposals. We find that synchrotron emission from a mildly relativistic cocoon with a Lorentz factor of 2-3, as considered in the literature, generates a too soft, too long, and too bright prompt emission. Off-axis view of an structured jet with a Lorentz factor of about 10 can reproduce observations, but needs a very efficient transfer of kinetic energy to electrons in internal shocks, which is disfavored by particle in cell simulations. We also comment on cocoon breakout as a mechanism for generation of the prompt gamma-ray. A relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of about 100 and a density lower than typical short GRBs seems to be the most plausible model and we conclude that GRB 170817A was intrinsically faint. Based on this result and findings of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BNS merger in the literature we discuss physical and astronomical conditions, which may lead to such faint short GRBs

title: An explosion is triggered by the late collapse of the compact remnant from a neutron star merger
authors: Antonios Nathanail
topic: The collapse of this compact remnant to a black- hole-torus system is expected to give rise to a powerful jet and a short gamma-ray burst. Nevertheless, if the collapse is delayed half a second or so, the surrounding matter would be already accreted and/or expelled and hence no torus will be formed. However, the collapse itself will give rise to a quasi-isotropic magnetized fireball. This magnetic bomb will dissipate much of its energy due to magnetic re-connection and will produce the prompt emission, when the fireball will become transparent to gamma-rays. The energy range of such an explosion depends on the initial magnetic field strength of the two neutron stars and the amplification of the magnetic energy during merger. We discuss the production of a quasi-isotropic magnetized fireball and its subsequent interaction with the ejected matter during merger, as the outcome of the coalescence of a binary neutron star system.

In the next years, the searches for VHE EM counterparts will become more effective thanks to the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) We present a comprehensive study on the prospects for joint GW and VHE EM observations of merging BNSs with Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and CTA, based on detailed simulations of the multi-messenger emission and detection.

title: A magnetar origin for the kilonova ejecta in GW170817
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Todd A. Thompson, Eliot Quataert
topic: We propose an alternative ejecta source: the neutrino-heated, magnetically-accelerated wind from the strongly-magnetized hypermassive NS (HMNS) remnant. A rapidly-spinning HMNS with an ordered surface magnetic field of strength B ~ 1-3e14 G and lifetime t_rem ~ 0.1-1 s can simultaneously explain the velocity, total mass, and electron fraction of the blue KN ejecta. The inferred HMNS lifetime is close to its Alfven crossing time, suggesting global magnetic torques could be responsible for bringing the HMNS into solid body rotation and instigating its gravitational collapse. Different origins for the KN ejecta may be distinguished by their predictions for the emission in the first hours after the merger, when the luminosity is enhanced by heating from internal shocks; the latter are likely generic to any temporally-extended ejecta source (e.g. magnetar or accretion disk wind) and are not unique to the emergence of a relativistic jet.

authors: Raffaella Margutti, K.D. Alexander, X. Xie, L. Sironi, B.D. Metzger, A. Kathirgamaraju, W. Fong, P.K. Blanchard, E. Berger, A. MacFadyen, et al
topic: We report deep Chandra, HST and VLA observations of the binary neutron star event GW170817 at t less 160 d after merger. These observations show that GW170817 has been steadily brightening with time and might have now reached its peak, and constrain the emission process as non-thermal synchrotron emission where the cooling frequency νc is above the X-ray band and the synchrotron frequency nu_m is below the radio band. The very simple power-law spectrum extending for eight orders of magnitude in frequency enables the most precise measurement of the index p of the distribution of non-thermal relativistic electrons N(gamma)\prop to gamma−p accelerated by a shock launched by a NS-NS merger to date.  We find p=2.17 \pm 0.01, which indicates that radiation from ejecta with Gamma similar 3−10 dominates the observed emission. While constraining the nature of the emission process, these observations do \emph{not} constrain the nature of the relativistic ejecta. We employ simulations of explosive outflows launched in NS ejecta clouds to show that the spectral and temporal evolution of the non-thermal emission from GW170817 is consistent with both emission from radially stratified quasi-spherical ejecta traveling at mildly relativistic speeds, \emph{and} emission from off-axis collimated ejecta characterized by a narrow cone of ultra-relativistic material with slower wings extending to larger angles. In the latter scenario, GW170817 harbored a normal SGRB directed away from our line of sight.

topic: Surface abundance observations of halo stars hint at the occurrence of r-process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity... Possible loci of early-Universe r-process nucleosynthesis are the ejecta of either black hole--neutron star or neutron star--neutron star binary mergers. Here we study the effect of the inclination--eccentricity oscillations raised by a tertiary (e.g. a star) on the coalescence time scale of the inner compact object binaries. Our results are highly sensitive to the assumed initial distribution of the inner binary semi-major axes. Our results provide additional support to the compact object merger scenario for r-process nucleosynthesis.

topic: The electromagnetic signal began approximately 2 seconds post-merger with a weak, short burst of gamma-rays, which was followed over the next hours and days by the ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared emission from a radioactively- powered kilonova. Later, non-thermal rising X-ray and radio emission was observed. The low luminosity of the gamma-rays and the rising non-thermal flux from the source at late times could indicate that we are outside the opening angle of the beamed relativistic jet. Alternatively, the emission could be arising from a cocoon of material formed from the interaction between a jet and the merger ejecta. Here we present late-time optical detections and deep near-infrared limits on the emission from GW170817 at 110 days post-merger. Our new observations are at odds with expectations of late-time emission from kilonova models, being too bright and blue. Instead, the emission arises from the interaction between the relativistic ejecta of GW170817 and the interstellar medium. We show that this emission matches the expectations of a Gaussian structured relativistic jet, which would have launched a high luminosity short GRB to an aligned observer. However, other jet structure or cocoon models can also match current data - the future evolution of the afterglow will directly distinguish the origin of the emission.

title: Optimized Radio Follow Up of Binary Neutron-Star Mergers
authors: Dario Carbone, Alessandra Corsi
topic: We simulate GW170817-like radio transients, and radio afterglows generated by fast jets with isotropic energy expanding in a low-density interstellar medium bserved from different viewing angles (from slightly off-axis to largely off-axis). We then determine the optimal timing of GHz radio observations following the precise localization of the BNS radio counterpart candidate, assuming a sensitivity comparable to that of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The optimization is done so as to ensure that properties such as viewing angle and circumstellar density can be correctly reconstructed with the minimum number of observations. We show that radio is the optimal band to explore the fastest ejecta from BNSs in low-density ISM, since the optical emission is likelyto be dominated by the so-called `kilonova' component, while X-rays from the jet are detectable only for a small subset of the BNS models considered here.

title: The Origin of the Prompt Emission for Short GRB 170817A: Photosphere Emission or Synchrotron Emission?
authors: Yan-Zhi Meng, Jin-Jun Geng, Bin-Bin Zhang, Jun-Jie Wei et al
topic: The origin of this short GRB is still under debate, but a plausible interpretation is that it is due to the off-axis emission from a structured jet. We consider two possibilities. First, since the best-fit spectral model for the main pulse of GRB 170817A is a cutoff power law with a hard low-energy photon index (α=−0.62+0.49−0.54), we consider an off-axis photosphere model. We develop a theory of photosphere emission in a structured jet and find that such a model can reproduce a low-energy photon index that is softer than a blackbody through enhancing high-latitude emission. The model can naturally account for the observed spectrum. The best-fit Lorentz factor along the line of sight is \sim 20, which demands that there is a significant delay between the merger and jet launching. Alternatively, we consider that the emission is produced via synchrotron radiation in an optically thin region in an expanding jet with decreasing magnetic fields.

topic: We overview observational evidence supporting this scenario including: the total amount of r-process elements in the Galaxy, extreme metal poor stars, geological radioactive elemental abundances, dwarf galaxies, and short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). The ultra-violet, optical, and near infrared observations point to r-process elements that have been synthesized in the merger ejecta. The rate and ejected mass inferred from GW170817 and the EM counterparts are consistent with other observations. We find however that, within simple one zone chemical evolution models (based on merger rates with reasonable delay time distributions as expected from evolutionary models, or from observations of sGRBs), it is difficult to reconcile the current observations of the europium abundance history of Galactic stars for [Fe/H] more then −1. This implies that to account for the role of mergers in the Galactic chemical evolution, we need a Galactic model with multiple populations that have different spatial distributions and/or varying formation rates.

authors: Shlomo Dado, Arnon Dar, Alvaro De Rujula
topic: The rich and complex data obtained from multi-wavelength observations of SHB170817A, the short hard gamma ray burst (SHB) associated with GW170817 --the first neutron stars merger event detected in gravitational waves (GWs)-- are analyzed in the framework of the cannonball model of SHBs. In this model a highly relativistic jet is launched by fall back matter on the nascent neutron star (or black hole) into a surrounding glory (light from the surrounding wind nebula of the binary neutron stars) which was present already before the merger. The SHB was produced by inverse Compton scattering of glory photons by the jet, which was viewed far off-axis. The fading glory, which produced the initial UVOIR afterglow, was powered by a neutron star remnant. It was overtaken by a late time X-ray, UVOIR and radio afterglow produced by synchrotron radiation from the decelerating jet in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. If the radio afterglow of SHB170817A was indeed produced by the jet, it should display a superluminal motion relative to the SHB location, still detectable in VLA and VLBI radio observations.

authors: Xiang-Yu Wang, Zhi-Qiu Huang
topic: It has been suggested that this mildly relativistic outflow may represent a cocoon of material. We suggest that the velocity gradient profile may form during the stage that the cocoon is breaking out of the merger ejecta, resulted from shock propagation down a density gradient. The cooling of the hot relativistic cocoon material immediately after it breaks out should have produced soft X-ray to UV radiation at tens of seconds to hours after the merger. The soft X-ray emission has a luminosity of 10^45 over a period of tens of seconds for a merger event like GW 170817. The UV emission shows a rise initially and peaks at about a few hours with a luminosity of 10^42

authors: Davide Lazzati, Rosalba Perna, Brian J. Morsony, Diego López-Cámara, Matteo Cantiello, Riccardo Ciolfi, Bruno giacomazzo, Jared C. Workman
topic: Here we show that structured jets with a relativistic, energetic core surrounded by slower and less energetic wings produce afterglow emission that brightens characteristically with time, as recently seen in the afterglow of GW170817. Initially, we only see the relatively slow material moving towards us. As time passes, larger and larger sections of the outflow become visible, increasing the luminosity of the afterglow. The late appearance and increasing brightness of the multi-wavelength afterglow of GW170817 allow us to constrain the geometry of its ejecta and thus reveal the presence of an off-axis jet pointing about 30 degrees away from Earth. Our results confirm a single origin for BNS mergers and short GRBs: GW170817 produced a structured outflow with a highly relativistic core and a canonical short GRB.

title: A more stringent constraint on the mass ratio of binary neutron star merger GW170817
authors: He Gao, Zhoujian Cao, Shunke Ai, Bing Zhang
topic: Here we propose that if one can constrain the dynamical ejecta mass through performing kilonova modeling of the optical/IR data, by utilizing an empirical relation between the dynamical ejecta mass and the mass ratio of NS binaries, one may place a more stringent constraint on the mass ratio of the system. For instance, considering that the red "kilonova" component is powered by the dynamical ejecta, we reach a tight constraint on the mass ratio in the range of 0.46-0.59. Alternatively, if the blue "kilonova" component is powered by the dynamical ejecta, the mass ratio would be constrained in the range of 0.53-0.67. Overall, such a multi-messenger approach could narrow down the mass ratio of GW170817 system to the range of 0.46-0.67, which gives a more precise estimation of the individual NS mass than pure GW signal analysis

title: Prompt emission from the counter jet of a short gamma-ray burst
authors: Ryo Yamazaki, Kunihito Ioka, Takashi Nakamura
topic: The counter jet of a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) has not yet been observed, while recent discoveries of gravitational waves (GWs) from a binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 and the associated sGRB 170817A have demonstrated that off-axis sGRB jets are detectable. We calculate the prompt emission from the counter jet of an sGRB and show that it is typically 23-26 mag in the optical-infrared band 10-10^3 sec after the GWs for an sGRB 170817A-like event, which is brighter than the early macronova (or kilonova) emission and detectable by LSST in the near future. We also propose a new method to constrain the unknown jet properties, such as the Lorentz factor, opening angle, emission radii, and jet launch time, by observing both the forward and counter jets. To scrutinize the counter jets, space GW detectors like DECIGO are powerful in forecasting the merger time (less or equal 1 sec) and position (less or equal 1 arcmin) (similar a week) before the merger.

title: A magnetically driven origin for the low luminosity GRB 170817A associated with GW170817
authors: H. Tong, C. Yu, L. Huang
topic: The gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A associated with GW170817 is subluminous and subenergetic compared with other typical short GRBs. It may be due to a relativistic jet viewed off-axis, or a structured jet, or cocoon emission. Giant flares from magnetars may possibly be ruled out. However, the luminosity and energetics of GRB 170817A is coincident with that of magnetar giant flares. After the coalescence of the binary neutron star, a hypermassive neutron star may be formed. The hypermassive neutron star may have magnetar-strength magnetic field. During the collapse of the hypermassive neutron star, the magnetic field energy will also be released. This giant-flare-like event may explain the the luminosity and energetics of GRB 170817A. Bursts with similar luminosity and energetics are expected in future neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole mergers.

authors: Om S. Salafia, Gabriele Ghisellini, Giancarlo Ghirlanda, Monica Colpi
topic: We show that the delay between GRB170817A and GW170817 is incompatible with de-beamed emission from an off-axis relativistic jet. The prompt emission and the subsequent radio and X-ray observations can instead be interpreted within a giant-flare-like scenario, being the result of a relativistic outflow driven by the ultra-strong magnetic field produced by magnetohydrodynamic amplification during the merger of the progenitor double neutron-star binary. Within such picture, the data indicate that the outflow must be endowed with a steep velocity profile, with a relatively fast tail extending to Gamma~8.

title: A long-lived remnant neutron star after GW170817 inferred from its associated kilonova
authors: Yun-Wei Yu, Liang-Duan Liu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: However, whether a long-lived remnant NS could be formed during this merger event remains unknown, although such a central engine has been suggested by afterglow observations of some short-duration GRBs. By invoking this long-lived remnant NS, we here propose a model of hybrid energy sources for the kilonova AT2017gfo associated with GW 170817. While the early emission of AT2017gfo is still powered radioactively as usually suggested, its late emission is primarily caused by delayed energy injection from the remnant NS. S. These self-consistent results indicate that a long-lived remnant NS, which must own a very stiff equation of state, had been formed during the merger event of GW170817. This provides a very stringent constraint on the strong interaction in nuclear-quark matter. It is further implied that such GW events could provide a probe of the early spin and magnetic evolutions of NSs, e.g., the burying of surface magnetic fields.

topic: In this paper, we show that the X-ray, optical and radio fluxes are consistent with the synchrotron forward-shock model viewed off-axis when the matter in the outflow is parametrized through a power law velocity distribution. We discuss the origin of the γ-ray peak in terms of internal and external shocks. We show that the γ-ray flux might be consistent with a synchrotron self-Compton reverse-shock model observed at high latitudes. Comparing the best-fit values obtained after describing the γ-ray, X-ray, optical and radio fluxes with our model, we find that the afterglow and γ-ray emission occurred in different regions and also evidence to propose that the progenitor environment was entrained with magnetic fields and therefore, we argue for the presence of the magnetic field amplification in the binary neutron star merger.

The gravitational potential of the Milky Way provides a potential source of Shapiro time delay difference between the arrival of photons and GWs, and we demonstrate that the nearly coincident detection of the GW and EM signals can yield strong limits on anomalous gravitational time delay, through updating the previous limits taking into account details of Milky Way's gravitational potential. Finally, we also obtain an intriguing limit on the size of the prompt emission region of GRB 170817A, and discuss implications for the emission mechanism of short gamma-ray bursts.

The afterglow emission is broadband, visible across the entire electro-magnetic window from γ-ray to radio frequencies. The flux evolution in these frequencies is sensitive to the multi-dimensional afterglow physical parameter space. Observations of gravitational wave (GW) from BNS mergers in spatial and temporal coincidence with SGRB and associated afterglows can provide valuable constraints on afterglow physics.

To make constraints on a relativistic jet from the NS merger, we calculate the EM signals in (1) the short gamma-ray burst sGRB 170817A from an off-axis jet, (2) the optical-infrared macronova (or kilonova), especially the blue macronova, from a jet-powered cocoon, and (3) the X-ray and radio afterglows from the interaction between the jet and interstellar medium. We find that a typical sGRB jet is consistent with these observations, and there is a parameter space to explain all the observations in a unified fashion

topic: However, it is still unclear which astrophysical site between core-collapse supernovae and neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) mergers produced most of the r-process elements in the universe. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models can test these scenarios by quantifying the frequency and yields required to reproduce the amount of europium (Eu) observed in galaxies. Although NS-NS mergers have become popular candidates, their required frequency (or rate) needs to be consistent with that obtained from gravitational wave measurements. Here we address the first NS-NS merger detected by LIGO/Virgo (GW170817) and its associated Gamma-ray burst and analyze their implication on the origin of r-process elements. This is the first study that directly combines nuclear physics uncertainties with GCE calculations. If GW170817 is a representative event, NS-NS mergers can produce Eu in sufficient amounts and are likely to be the main r-process site.

authors: Gavin P Lamb, Shiho Kobayashi
topic: In this paper, we assume that the γ-ray emission is caused by energy dissipation within a relativistic jet and we model the afterglow synchrotron emission from a reverse- and forward-shock in the outflow. We show the afterglow for a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet with a high Lorentz-factor (Gamma); a low-Gamma and low-kinetic energy jet; a low-Gamma, high kinetic energy jet; structured jets viewed at an inclination within the jet-half-opening angle; and an off-axis `typical' GRB jet. All jet models will produce observable afterglows on various timescales. The late-time afterglow from 10-110 days can be fit by a Gaussian structured jet viewed at a moderate inclination, however, the GRB is not directly reproduced by this model.

title: Estimating the Contribution of Dynamical Ejecta in the Kilonova Associated with GW170817
authors: LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Collaboration
topic: The source of the gravitational-wave signal GW170817, very likely a binary neutron star merger, was also observed electromagnetically, providing the first multi-messenger observations of this type. The two week long electromagnetic counterpart had a signature indicative of an r-process-induced optical transient known as a kilonova. This Letter examines how the mass of the dynamical ejecta can be estimated without a direct electromagnetic observation of the kilonova, using gravitational-wave measurements and a phenomenological model calibrated to numerical simulations of mergers with dynamical ejecta. Specifically, we apply the model to the binary masses inferred from the gravitational-wave measurements, and use the resulting mass of the dynamical ejecta to estimate its contribution (without the effects of wind ejecta) to the corresponding kilonova light curves from various models. The distributions of dynamical ejecta mass range between 10^3 10^2 for various equations of state, assuming the neutron stars are rotating slowly. In addition, we use our estimates of the dynamical ejecta mass and the neutron star merger rates inferred from GW170817 to constrain the contribution of events like this to the r-process element abundance in the Galaxy when ejecta mass from post-merger winds is neglected. We find that if \geq 10% of the matter dynamically ejected from BNS mergers is converted to r-process elements, GW170817-like BNS mergers could fully account for the amount of r-process material observed in the Milky Way.

title: Evidence for Cocoon Emission from the Early Light Curve of SSS17a
authors: Anthony L. Piro, Juna A. Kollmeier
topic: Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the first optical counterpart to the gravitational wave event GW170817. Although its light curve on the timescale of weeks roughly matches the expected luminosity and red color of an r-process powered transient, the explanation for the blue emission from high velocity material over the first few days is not as clear. Here we show that the power-law evolution of the luminosity, temperature, and photospheric radius during these early times can be explained by cooling of shock heated material around the neutron star merger. This heating is likely from the interaction of the gamma-ray burst jet with merger debris, so-called cocoon emission. We summarize the properties of this emission and provide formulae that can be used to study future detections of shock cooling from merging neutron stars. This argues that optical transient surveys should search for such early, blue light if they wish to find off-axis gamma-ray bursts and double neutron star gravitational wave events as soon as possible after the merger.

title: Binary neutron star merger rate via the luminosity function of short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Debdutta Paul
topic: The luminosity function of short Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) is modelled by using the available catalogue data of all short GRBs (sGRBs) detected till October, 2017. The luminosities are estimated via the "pseudo-redshifts" obtained from the "Yonetoku correlation", assuming a standard delay distribution between the cosmic star formation rate and the production rate of their progenitors. While the simple powerlaw is ruled out to high confidence, the data is fit well both by exponential cutoff powerlaw and broken powerlaw models. Using the derived parameters of these models along with conservative values in the jet opening angles seen from afterglow observations, the true rate of short GRBs are derived.

topic: We present our observations of electromagnetic transients associated with GW170817/GRB 170817A using optical telescopes of Chilescope observatory and Big Scanning Antenna (BSA) of Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory at 110MHz. The Chilescope observatory detected an optical transient of \sim 19m on the third day in the outskirts of the galaxy NGC 4993; we continued observations following its rapid decrease. We put an upper limit of 1.5×104 Jy on any radio source with a duration of 10-60 s which may be associated with GW170817/GRB 170817A. The prompt gamma-ray emission consists of two distinctive components - a hard short pulse delayed by \sim 2 seconds with respect to the LIGO signal and softer thermal pulse with T\sim 10 keV lasting for another \sim 2 seconds. The appearance of a thermal component at the end of the burst is unusual for short GRBs. Both the hard and the soft components do not satisfy the Amati relation, making GRB 170817A distinctively different from other short GRBs. Based on gamma-ray and optical observations, we develop a model for the prompt high-energy emission associated with GRB 170817A. The merger of two neutron stars creates an accretion torus of \sim 10−2Msun, which supplies the black hole with magnetic flux and confines the Blandford-Znajek-powered jet. We associate the hard prompt spike with the quasispherical breakout of the jet from the disk wind. As the jet plows through the wind with subrelativistic velocity, it creates a radiation-dominated shock that heats the wind material to tens of kiloelectron volts, producing the soft thermal component.

topic: Here we discuss the role of neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the light of the first direct detection of such an event in both gravitational (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) waves. We analyse bolometric and NIR lightcurves of the first detected double neutron star merger and compare them to nuclear reaction network-based macronova models. The slope of the bolometric lightcurve is consistent with the radioactive decay of neutron star ejecta with Ye≲0.3 (but not larger), which provides strong evidence for an r-process origin of the electromagnetic emission. This rules out in particular "nickel winds" as major source of the emission. We find that the NIR lightcurves can be well fitted either with or without lanthanide-rich ejecta.

Although at similar epochs AT2017gfo appears fainter than every SGRB-associated KN claimed so far, we find three bursts (GRBs 050509B, 061201 and 080905A) where, if the reported redshifts are correct, deep upper limits rule out the presence of a KN similar to AT2017gfo by several magnitudes. Combined with the properties of previously claimed KNe in SGRBs this suggests considerable diversity in the properties of KN drawn from compact object mergers, despite the similar physical conditions that are expected in many NS-NS mergers

title: Repeating and Non-repeating Fast Radio Bursts from Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Shotaro Yamasaki, Tomonori Totani, Kenta Kiuchi
topic: However, the merger environment is polluted by dynamical ejecta, which may prohibit the radio signal to propagate. We examine this by using a general-relativistic simulation of a BNS merger, and show that the ejecta appears about 1 ms after the rotation speed of the merged star becomes the maximum. Therefore there is a time window in which an FRB signal can reach outside, and the short duration of non-repeating FRBs can be explained by screening after ejecta formation. A fraction of BNS mergers may leave a rapidly rotating and stable neutron star, and such objects may be the origin of repeating FRBs like FRB 121102.

First, we estimate that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at merger could amplify the magnetic-field energy up to \sim 1% of the thermal energy. Second, we find that the magnetorotational instability in the RMNS envelope and torus with ρ less 10^13 g cm−3 sustains magneto-turbulent state and the effective viscous parameter in these regions is likely to converge to approx 0.01--0.02 with respect to the grid resolution.

authors: Nicole M. Lloyd-Ronning
topic: We investigate the expected radio emission from short GRBs, guided by the observed distributions of their afterglow parameters. Our motivation is to explore the radio signatures of the forward and reverse shock in a sGRB jet, as well as the off-axis jet component and radio emission from the dynamical ejecta. We estimate the fraction of GRBs detectable in the radio that may be coincident with a GW signal from a neutron star (NS) merger. At the distance to which aLIGO at design specification is sensitive to GWs from NS mergers, we may detect up to 20 % of off-axis jet radio components of these events, and up to about 10 % of events with radio emission from the tidal ejecta shocking with the external medium. We discuss our results in light of the Next Generation Very Large Array, expected to make significant progress in detecting radio signals from sGRBs.

title: Monte-Carlo closure for moment-based transport schemes in general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics simulations
authors: Francois Foucart
topic:  Photon transport plays a crucial role in radiatively dominated accretion disks, while neutrino transport is critical to core-collapse supernovae and to the modeling of electromagnetic transients and nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. However, evolving the full Boltzmann equations of radiative transport is extremely expensive. Here, we describe the implementation in the general relativistic SpEC code of a cheaper radiation hydrodynamics method which theoretically converges to a solution of Boltzmann's equation in the limit of infinite numerical resources. The algorithm is based on a gray two-moment scheme, in which we evolve the energy density and momentum density of the radiation. Two-moment schemes require a closure which fills in missing information about the energy spectrum and higher-order moments of the radiation. Instead of the approximate analytical closure currently used in core-collapse and merger simulations, we complement the two-moment scheme with a low-accuracy Monte-Carlo evolution. The Monte-Carlo results can provide any or all of the missing information in the evolution of the moments, as desired by the user.

title: Closed-form tidal approximants for binary neutron star gravitational waveforms constructed from high-resolution numerical relativity simulations
authors: Tim Dietrich, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Wolfgang Tichy
topic: We construct closed-form gravitational waveforms (GWs) with tidal effects for the coalescence and merger of binary neutron stars. The method relies on a new set of eccentricity-reduced and high-resolution numerical relativity (NR) simulations and is composed of three steps. First, tidal contributions to the GW phase are extracted from the time-domain NR data. Second, those contributions are employed to fix high-order coefficients in an effective and resummed post-Newtonian expression. Third, frequency-domain tidal approximants are built using the stationary phase approximation. Our tidal approximants are valid from the low frequencies to the strong-field regime and up to merger. They can be analytically added to any binary black hole GW model to obtain a binary neutron star waveform, either in the time or in the frequency domain. This work provides simple, flexible, and accurate models ready to be used in both searches and parameter estimation of binary neutron star events.

title: Detecting binary compact-object mergers with gravitational waves: Understanding and Improving the sensitivity of the PyCBC search
authors: Alexander H. Nitz, Thomas Dent, Tito Dal Canton, Stephen Fairhurst, Duncan A. Brown
topic: We present an improved search for binary compact-object mergers using a network of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We model a volumetric, isotropic source population and incorporate the resulting distribution over signal amplitude, time delay, and coalescence phase into the ranking of candidate events. We describe an improved modeling of the background distribution, and demonstrate incorporating a prior model of the binary mass distribution in the ranking of candidate events. We find a approx 10% and approx 20% increase in detection volume for simulated binary neutron star and neutron star--binary black hole systems, respectively, corresponding to a reduction of the false alarm rates assigned to signals by between one and two orders of magnitude.

title: Structure of Stable Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants: Role of Initial Spin
authors: Wolfgang Kastaun, Riccardo Ciolfi, Andrea Endrizzi, Bruno Giacomazzo
topic: We present general relativistic numerical simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with different initial spin configurations. We focus on models with stars of mass 1.4 M_sol each, which employ the equation of state (EOS) by Shen, Horowitz, and Teige, and which result in stable NSs as merger remnants. We present visualizations of the fluid flow and temperature distribution and find a strong impact of the spin on vortex structure and nonaxisymmetric deformation. We compute the radial mass distribution and the rotation profile in the equatorial plane using recently developed measures independent of spatial gauge, revealing slowly rotating cores that can be well approximated by the cores of spherical stars. We also study the influence of the spin on the inspiral phase and the gravitational wave (GW) signal.

title: Structure of Stable Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants: a Case Study
authors: Wolfgang Kastaun, Riccardo Ciolfi, Bruno Giacomazzo
topic: In this work, we study the merger of two neutron stars with a gravitational mass of 1.4 M_sol each, employing the Shen-Horowitz-Teige equation of state. This equation of state is a corner case, allowing the formation of a stable neutron star with the given total baryonic mass of 3.03 M_sol. We investigate in unprecedented detail the structure of the remnant, in particular the mass distribution, the thermal structure, and the rotation profile. We also compute fluid trajectories both inside the remnant and those relevant for the formation of the disk. We find a peanut-shaped fluid flow inside the remnant following a strong m=2 perturbation. Moreover, the flow is locally compressive, causing the appearance of dynamic hot spots. Further, we introduce new diagnostic measures that are easy to implement in numeric simulations and that allow to quantify mass and compactness of merger remnants in a well-defined way.

title: Possible role of magnetic reconnection in the electromagnetic counterpart of binary black hole merger
authors: F. Fraschetti
topic: We propose a qualitative scenario to interpret the argued association between the direct measurement of the gravitational wave event GW150914 by Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo collaborations and the hard X-ray transient detected by Fermi-Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) 0.4 sec after. In a binary system of two gravitationally collapsing objects with a non-vanishing electric charge, the compenetration of the two magnetospheres occurring during the coalescence, through magnetic reconnection, produces a highly collimated relativistic outflow that becomes optically thin and shines in the GBM field of view. We propose that this process should be expected as a commonplace in the future joint gravitational/electromagnetic detections and, in case of neutron star-neutron star merger event, might lead to detectable X- or γ-ray precursors to, or transients associated with, the gravitational bursts.
