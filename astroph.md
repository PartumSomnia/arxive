title: Detectability of Electromagnetic counterparts from Neutron Star mergers: prompt emission vs afterglow
authors: S Mohan, M Saleem, L Resmi
topic: We compare the detectability of prompt and afterglow emission from off-axis jets, assuming standard detector thresholds. We find that for top-hat jets, afterglow is a more potential counterpart than the prompt emission even with unfavorable afterglow parameters. For structured jets with a Gaussian profile, prompt emission is more promising than the afterglows at extreme viewing angles.

The extent to which spallation modifies the final NSM isotopic yields depends on: the ejected abundances, which are determined by the NSM astrophysical conditions and the properties of nuclei far from stability, the ejecta velocity distribution and propagation in interstellar matter, and the spallation cross-sections. Observed solar and stellar r-process yields could thus constrain the velocity distribution of ejected neutron star matter, assuming NSMs are the dominant r-process source

title: Towards a paradigm change in the main heavy r-process nucleosynthesis sites
authors: Aldana Grichener, Noam Soker 
topic: We study the basic properties of three possible r-process scenarios (sites) and compare them to recent observations and theoretical simulations. We find that the common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can account for the different observations of r-process nucleosynthesis, including the presence of r-process-rich low-metalicity stars in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The neutron star (NS)-NS merger scenario and the collapsar scenario encounter some difficulties. Despite that, we conclude that it is very likely that more than one r-process scenario exists, with a significant contribution by the CEJSN r-process scenario. We give a prescription to include this scenario in population synthesis studies of the r-process.

We develop a phase-agnostic likelihood model that uses only the spectral content for parameter estimation and demonstrate the calculation of a Bayesian upper limit in the absence of a signal.

authors: Tim Dietrich, Katy Clough
topic: we perform numerical relativity simulations of a binary neutron star merger, including a phenomenological description of the nucleon-nucleon-axion bremsstrahlung to quantify the effects of such a cooling channel on the dynamical evolution. While our simulations show a difference in the temperature profile of the merger remnant, the imprint of the axion via nucleon-nucleon-axion bremsstrahlung on the emitted gravitational wave signal and the ejecta mass is too small to improve constraints on the axion mass with current or future planned detectors. Whilst we consider a limited number of cases, and a simplified cooling model, these broadly represent the "best case" scenario, thus, a more thorough investigation is unlikely to change the conclusions, at least for this particular interaction channel.

We find that an extrapolation of the post-peak temporal slope of GW170817 to the luminosities of cosmological short GRBs matches their observed jet break times, suggesting that their explosion properties are similar, and that the primary difference in GW170817 is viewing angle.

title: Using failed supernovae to constrain the Galactic r-process element production
authors: B. Wehmeyer, C. Frohlich, B. Côté, M. Pignatari, F.-K. Thielemann
topic: The large scatter of r-process elements in the early Galaxy suggests that the r-process is made by rare events, like compact binary mergers and rare sub-classes of supernovae. Although being rare, neutron star mergers alone have difficulties to explain the observed enhancement of r-process elements in the lowest metallicity stars compared to Fe. In this work we investigate another complementary scenario, where the r-process occurs in neutron star-black hole mergers in addition to neutron star mergers. Neutron star-black hole mergers would eject similar amounts of r-process matter as neutron star mergers, but only the neutron star progenitor would have produced Fe.

The combination of dilution and small number statistics produces a large scatter in the expected r-process enrichment within a single UFD or classical dwarf galaxy. Comparison between our results and observed europium abundances reveals a tension that even a systematic choice of optimistic parameters in our models cannot release. Such a discrepancy could point to the need of additional r-process production sites that suffer less severe dilution or to a population of extremely fast merging binaries.

We show that the small but non-negligible optical depths lead to neutrino transport globally coupling the disk electron fraction, which we capture by solving the transport equation with a Monte Carlo method. The resulting absorption drives up the electron fraction in a structured, continuous outflow, with electron fraction as high as Ye∼0.4 in the extreme polar region. We show via nuclear reaction network and radiative transfer calculations that nucleosynthesis in the disk wind will produce a blue kilonova.

title: GW170817 Afterglow Reveals that Short Gamma-Ray Bursts are Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Yiyang Wu, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We systematically investigate the outflow structure of GW170817 in comparison with a sample of 27 cosmological short GRBs by modelling their afterglow light curves. We find that cosmological short GRBs share the same outflow structures with GW170817, relativistic structured jets. The similarity between the GW170817 outflow structure and those of cosmological short GRBs indicates that cosmological short GRBs are likely neutron star mergers.

title: Constraining coherent low frequency radio flares from compact binary mergers
authors: A. Rowlinson, G.E. Anderson
topic: For this paper, we constrain this coherent radio emission using the deepest available constraints for GRB 150424A, which were obtained via a triggered observation with the Murchison Widefield Array. We then expand this analysis to determine the properties of magnetar merger remnants that may be formed via a general population of binary neutron star mergers. Our results demonstrate that many of the potential coherent emission mechanisms that have been proposed for such events can be detected or very tightly constrained by the complementary strategies used by the current generation of low-frequency radio telescopes

authors: Alexander P. Ji, Maria R. Drout, Terese T. Hansen
topic: The lanthanide fraction (XLa) is a measurable quantity in both kilonovae and metal-poor stars, but it has not previously been explicitly calculated for stars. Here, we compute the lanthanide fraction distribution of metal-poor stars to enable comparison to current and future kilonovae. For neutron star mergers to remain viable as the dominant r-process site, future kilonova observations should be preferentially lanthanide-rich. These high-XLa kilonovae may be fainter and more rapidly evolving than GW170817, posing a challenge for discovery and follow-up observations

This allows us to (i) study the emerging structure and amplification of the magnetic field and observe a clear saturation at magnetic energy 10^51. We follow the magnetically supported expansion of the outer layers of the remnant NS and its evolution into an ellipsoidal shape without any surrounding torus. We also argue that the conditions at the end of the simulation disfavor later jet formation on subsecond timescales if no BH is formed.

authors: Gor Oganesyan, Stefano Ascenzi, Marica Branchesi, Om Sharan Salafia, Simone Dall'Osso, Giancarlo Ghirlanda
topic: Here we show that the high-latitude emission from a structured jet can naturally produce an X-ray plateau in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves, independent of the radiation from an external shock. We calculate the radiation from a switched-off shell featuring an angular structure in both its relativistic bulk motion and intrinsic brightness. Our model is able to explain the shallow decay phase (plateau) often observed in GRB X-ray light curves. We discuss the possible contribution of the structured jet high-latitude emission to other distinctive features of GRB X-ray light curves, and its capability to explain the chromatic optical/X-ray light curve properties.

topic: Here we investigate the use of fine-structure, line-binned opacities that preserve the integral of the opacity over frequency. Advantages of this area-preserving approach over the traditional expansion-opacity formalism include the ability to pre-calculate opacity tables that are independent of the type of hydrodynamic expansion and that eliminate the computational expense of calculating opacities within radiation-transport simulations. Tabular opacities are generated for all 14 lanthanides as well as a representative actinide element, uranium. We demonstrate that spectral simulations produced with the line-binned opacities agree well with results produced with the more accurate continuous Monte Carlo Sobolev approach, as well as with the commonly used expansion-opacity formalism

authors: N. Fraija, D. Lopez-Camara, A.C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, P. Veres, S. Dichiara
topic: We calculate the light curves obtained from an analytic model in which the synchrotron and SSC emission (in the fast- or slow-cooling regime) of an off-axis top-hat jet and a quasi-spherical outflow are decelerated in either a homogeneous or a wind-like circumburst medium. We show that the synchrotron emission of the quasi-spherical outflow is stronger than that of the off-axis jet during the first \sim 10 - 20 days, and weaker during the next \geq 80 days. For GRB 170817A, we find using our model that the synchrotron emission generated by the quasi-spherical outflow and off-axis top-hat jet increase.

Our models that fit the bolometric luminosity of AT 2017gfo (the kilonova associated with the first neutron star merger discovered in gravitational waves, GW170817) do not simultaneously fit the B, V, and I time evolution. However, we find that the trends of the evolution in B and V magnitudes are better matched by the fallback model relative to the pulsar model, implying the time dependence of the remnant source influences the color evolution.

To parameterize the nuclear EoS, we use a different approach, expanding from pure nuclear matter rather than from symmetric nuclear matter to make use of recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations.

In this case, in fact, the merger remnant has an excess angular momentum yielding a more extended and "colder" object, with reduced ability to shed mass dynamically.

We show that the accumulation of fissioning material during the r process can strongly affect the free neutron abundance after the r-process freeze-out.

The very low-Ye, fission-cycling ejecta of an r-process event need only constitute 10-30% of the total ejecta mass to accommodate most actinide abundances of metal-poor stars. We find that our empirical Ye distributions of ejecta are similar to those inferred from studies of GW170817 mass ejecta ratios, which is consistent with neutron-star mergers being a source of the heavy elements in metal-poor, r-process enhanced stars.

topic: Here, we perform a set of simulations of low-mass NSBH mergers, including systems compatible with GW170817. Our simulations use a composition and temperature dependent equation of state (DD2) and approximate neutrino transport, but no magnetic fields. We find that low-mass NSBH mergers produce remnant disks significantly less massive than previously expected, and consistent with the post-merger outflow mass inferred from GW170817 for moderately asymmetric mass ratio. The dynamical ejecta produced by systems compatible with GW170817 is negligible except if the mass ratio and black hole spin are at the edge of the allowed parameter space. That dynamical ejecta is cold, neutron-rich, and surprisingly slow for ejecta produced during the tidal disruption of a neutron star.

topic: Although high-energy neutrinos were not detected from this event, mergers of neutron stars are expected to produce such high-energy particles. Relativistic jets are launched when neutron stars merge. If the jets contain protons, they can emit high-energy neutrinos through photomeson production. In addition, neutron star mergers produce massive and fast ejecta, which can be a source of Galactic high-energy cosmic rays above the knee.

This framework can be expressed using a set of five physically-motivated parameters that span a narrow range of values for realistic EOS and are able to capture the leading-order effects of degenerate matter on the thermal pressure.

We show that precise component mass measurements of ≈20 double neutron stars are required in order to determine with high confidence (a Bayes factor of 150) if recycled and non-recycled neutron stars come from a common distribution. Approximately 60 are needed in order to establish the detailed shape of the distributions.

topic: Under the assumption that a Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) is ultimately produced by a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet from a highly spinning black hole BH, we put limits on the magnetic field and BH mass needed to power observed long and short GRBs. For BHs in the range. We also discuss the implications and consequences of high magnetic fields in GRB BH-disk systems, in terms of MRI field growth and magnetically arrested disks. Finally, we examine the conditions under which the progenitor systems can retain enough angular momentum to create BHs spinning rapidly enough to power BZ jets.

topic: We estimate the accretion rates produced when a circumprimary gas disc is pushed into the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH) by the tidal force of the decaying secondary during a SMBH merger. Using the 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We find that discs with small inclination angles (\leq 10 degrees) produce an increase in luminosity exceeding the Eddington rate. we show that the misaligned snowplough effect remains important even for angles larger than the disc aspect ratio. The rise in the accretion rate produced by discs inclined at small angles to the binary orbit can produce an electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational wave signal emitted from final stages of the binary orbital decay.

title: Bayesian Analysis on the X-ray Spectra of the Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817
authors: En-Tzu Lin, Hoi-Fung Yu, Albert K.H. Kong
topic: For the first time, we present a Bayesian time-resolved spectral study of the X-ray afterglow datasets of GW170817/GRB17017A observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  While our results are consistent with the other works using Cash statistic within uncertainty, the Bayesian analysis we performed in this work have yielded Gaussian-like parameter distributions. We also obtained the parameter uncertainties directly from their posterior probability distributions. The X-ray flux has been fading since \sim160 days after the merger and has returned to the level as first discovered after one year. Our result shows that the X-ray spectrum of GW170817/GRB170817A is well-described by a simple power-law originated from non-thermal slow-cooling synchrotron radiation.

title: Discrete and Continuous Ejection Models of the Radio Source Associated with GW170817

topic: the discrete region includes all of the radio flux, and there is likely a synchrotron self absorption (SSA) spectral turnover. The velocity can constrain the kinematics and the SSA turnover has been used to constrain the size to much smaller than can be done with an unresolved VLBI image, allowing one to estimate the associated plasmoid size directly from the data and improve estimates of the energetics. Models of the radio emission for both a turbulent, protonic, discrete ballistic ejection and a high dissipation region within an otherwise invisible Poynting flux dominated positron-electron jet are considered. Even though only valid after day 110, this independent analysis augments traditional GRB light curve studies, providing additional constraints on the merger event.

We also show that these equations can be written as a first-order symmetric hyperbolic system, implying local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the equations of motion. We use an arbitrary equation of state and do not make any simplifying symmetry or near-equilibrium assumption, requiring only physically natural conditions on the fields. These results pave the way for the inclusion of bulk viscosity effects in simulations of gravitational-wave signals coming from neutron star mergers.

authors: Kai-Kai Duan, Zhi-Ping Jin, Fu-Wen Zhang, Yi-Ming Zhu, Xiang Li, Yi-Zhong Fan, Da-Ming Wei
topic:  the afterglow emission of the bright sGRBs and GW170817/GRB 170817A form a natural and continuous sequence, though separated by an observation time gap. If viewed on-axis, the forward shock afterglow emission of GW170817/GRB 170817A would be among the brightest ones detected so far. This provides a strong evidence for the GW170817-like merger origin of bright sGRBs, and suggests that the detection of the forward shock afterglow emission of most neutron star merger events are more challenging than the case of GW170817 since usually the mergers will be more distant and the viewing angles are plausibly higher.

authors: Andrei M. Beloborodov, Christoffer Lundman, Yuri Levin
topic: We suggest that neutron star mergers eject an ultra-relativistic envelope of mass 1e10-7 Msun, which helps explain the gamma-ray burst from GW170817. One ejection mechanism is the ablation of the neutron star surface by the burst of neutrinos in the first 30 microsec.  Another, more efficient, mechanism for inflating the ultra-relativistic envelope is an internal shock in the massive ejecta from the merger. A strong shock is expected if the merger product is a magnetar, which emits a centrifugally accelerated wind.

topic: However, these models generate local cosmic NS-NS merger rate in old host galaxies that are below the LIGO/Virgo estimate. The reason behind this tension is the predicted delay time distribution between star formation and NS-NS mergers that favors short delays. However, we show that such distribution is consistent with observations of Galactic NS-NS binaries; 50% of which show very long merger times (much longer than Hubble time). Once model distributions are convolved with continuous prolonged (10 Gyr) star formation in the Galactic disk, then 20-70% (depending on a model) of the predicted NS-NS population has very long current Galactic merger times

authors: Dhruv Desai, Brian D. Metzger, Francois Foucart
topic: One source of late-time engine activity is fall-back accretion of bound tidal ejecta. Here, we re-examine the impact of heating due to rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis on rate of the fall-back accretion, using ejecta properties obtained from numerical relativity simulations of NS-BH mergers in a toy model for the dynamical influence of nuclear heating. Depending on the mass of the remnant black hole, r-process heating can imprint a variety of fall-back curve shapes, ranging from temporal lulls of up to tens of seconds to complete late-time cut-off in the fall-back rate. This behavior is robust to realistic variations in the nuclear heating experienced by different parts of the ejecta.

Depending on the magnitude of the energy injection and the remnant density, we find two types of outflows: one with a narrow relativistic core and one with a wide-angle, but mildly relativistic outflow.

topic: We study the r-process enrichment of the stellar halo of the Milky Way through NSM, by tracing the typical r-process element Eu in the Munich-Groningen semi-analytic galaxy formation model, applied to three high resolution Aquarius dark matter simulations. In particular, we investigate the effect of the kick velocities that neutron star binaries receive upon their formation, in the building block galaxies (BBs) that partly formed the stellar halo by merging with our Galaxy.  We conclude that our assumption of instantaneous mixing is most likely inaccurate for modelling the r-process enrichment of the Galactic halo, or an additional production site for r-process elements is necessary to explain the presence of low-metallicity halo stars with high Eu abundances.

Our analysis suggests that GRB 170817A-like events are likely to be rare in existing SGRB catalogues. The best candidate for an analogue remains GRB 050906, where the Swift/BAT location was consistent with the galaxy IC0327 at d\apporx 132 Mpc. If binary neutron star merger rates are at the high end of current estimates, then our results imply that at most a few percent will be accompanied by detectable gamma-ray flashes in the forthcoming LIGO/Virgo science runs.

We show here that the broadband (radio, optical, X-ray) afterglow is consistent with a structured outflow where an ultra-relativistic jet,

topic: The multi-messenger observation of gamma-ray burst (GRB)\,170817A from the nearby binary neutron-star merger GW170817 demonstrated that low-energy γ-ray emission can be observed at relatively large angles from GRB jet axes. If such structured emission is typical, then the currently known sample of short GRBs with no distance measurements may contain multiple nearby off-axis events whose delayed afterglows could have gone undetected.

authors: Itai Linial, Re'em Sari
topic:  At early times, when the kilonova is still dominant, the synchrotron emitting electrons can efficiently cool by up-scattering the kilonova photos through inverse-Compton. Yet, the cooling frequency is not observed up to the X-ray band. This can only be explained if the source is moving at least at a mildly relativistic velocity. We find a lower limit on the source's bulk Lorentz factor of >2.1

We also compare our results to the secular approximation, and show that N-body simulations generally predict a larger number of mergers. Finally, these events can also be observable via their electromagnetic counterparts, thus making these compact object mergers especially valuable for cosmological and astrophysical purposes.

title: Hypermassive Neutron Star Disk Outflows and Blue Kilonovae
authors: Steven Fahlman, Rodrigo Fernández
topic: We study mass ejection from accretion disks around newly-formed hypermassive neutron stars (HMNS). Standard kilonova model fits to GW170817 require at least a lanthanide-poor ('blue') and lanthanide-rich ('red') component. but average disk outflow velocities from existing long-term HMNS simulations fall short of the inferred value 0.25c.  Here we use time-dependent, axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of HMNS disks to explore the limits of the model and its ability to account for observations. For physically plausible parameter choices compatible with GW170817, we find that hydrodynamic models that use shear viscosity to transport angular momentum cannot eject matter with mass-averaged velocities larger than \sim 0.15c. While outflow velocities in our simulations can exceed the asymptotic value for a steady-state neutrino-driven wind, the increase in the average velocity due to viscosity is not sufficient. Therefore, viscous HMNS disk winds cannot reproduce by themselves the ejecta properties inferred from multi-component fits to kilonova light curves from GW170817

It is found that the best description is given by a two-component mixture of skewed Student-t distributions, which outperforms any other model considered. This implies that the distribution of the studied parameters is intrinsically skewed, introducing spurious Gaussian components, and hence the third class is unlikely to be a real phenomenon. Its existence, based on statistical inference, is therefore rejected as unnecessary to explain the observations.

topic: In this work we use the results of these modeling (off-axis energetic relativistic outflow component launched) to examine the energy extraction process of the central engine. We show that the magnetic process (i.e., the Blandford-Znajek mechanism) is favored, while the neutrino process usually requires a too massive accretion disk if the duration of the central engine activity is comparable to the observed. We propose that the GRB observations are helpful to constrain the combined tidal parameter by adopting the accretion disk mass distribution estimated in BZ mechanism.

authors: K. P. Mooley, D. A. Frail, D. Dobie, E. Lenc, A. Corsi, K. De, A.J. Nayana, S. Makhathini, I. Heywood et al
topic: We present new 0.6-10 GHz observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 covering the period up to 300 days post-merger, taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and the MeerKAT telescope. Such a slope cannot be produced by a quasi-isotropic (cocoon-dominated) outflow, but is instead the classic signature of a relativistic jet. This provides strong observational evidence that GW170817 produced a successful jet, and directly demonstrates the link between binary neutron star mergers and short-hard GRBs. Using simple analytical arguments, we derive constraints on the geometry and the jet opening angle of GW170817. These results are consistent with those from our companion Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) paper, reporting superluminal motion in GW170817.

The EM likelihood is constructed from a fit to a large number of numerical relativity simulations which we combine with a lower bound on the mass of the remnant's accretion disk inferred from the modeling of the EM light curve. In comparison with previous works, our analysis yields a more precise determination of the tidal deformability of the binary, for which the EM data provide a lower bound, and of the mass ratio of the binary, with the EM data favoring a smaller mass asymmetry.

title: Jet launching from binary black hole-neutron star mergers: Dependence on black hole spin, binary mass ratio and magnetic field orientation
authors: Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro, Antonios Tsokaros
topic: sing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNS undergoing merger we showed that a magnetically--driven jet can be launched by the remnant if the NS is endowed with a dipole B field extending from the interior into the exterior as in a radio pulsar. Here, as a crucial step in establishing BHNS systems as viable progenitors of central engines that power short gamma--ray bursts (sGRBs) and thereby solidify their role as multimessenger sources, we survey different BHNS configurations that differ in BH spin. By the time we terminate our simulations, we do not observe either an outflow or a large-scale B field collimation in the other configurations we simulate. These results suggest that future multimessenger detections from BHNSs are more likely produced by binaries with highly spinning BH companions and small tilt-angle B fields.

topic: In this paper, we have investigated rotation-induced gravitational radiation from possibly existing, radially oscillating pulsars after binary neutron star mergers, and find that this mechanism can efficiently damp the radial oscillations. The resulting gravitational waves (GWs) could have a non-negligible contribution to the high-frequency spectrum. We provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of the event rate and suggest that such GW events would be detectable with the advanced LIGO/Virgo or next-generation detectors. Our discussion can also be applied to newborn, radially oscillating, millisecond pulsars formed through the other astrophysical processes.

topic: We show that a long-lived magnetized NS with a poloidal field is fully consistent with the electromagnetic dataset, when spin down losses are dominated by gravitational wave (GW) emission. The required ellipticity can result from a toroidal magnetic field component much stronger than the poloidal component, a configuration expected from a NS newly formed from a merger. Abrupt magnetic dissipation of the toroidal component can lead to the appearance of X-ray flares, analogous to the one observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. we identify a low-significance  temporal feature at 155 d, consistent with a sudden reactivation of the central NS. Energy injection from the NS spin down into the relativistic shock is negligible, and the underlying continuum is fully accounted for by a structured jet seen off-axis.

title: r-process enrichment of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies by fast merging double neutron stars
authors: Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Jeff. J. Andrews, Tassos Fragos, Phillip Macias, Evan Scannapieco
topic: However, it is difficult to reconcile the large natal kicks and long average merging times of Double Neutron Stars (DNSs), with the levels of r-process enrichment seen in ultra faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies such as Reticulum II and Tucana III. Assuming that such dwarf systems have lost a significant fraction of their stellar mass through tidal stripping, we conclude that contrary to most current models, it is the DNSs with rather large natal kicks but very short merging timescales that can enrich UFD-type galaxies. These binaries are either on highly eccentric orbits, or form with very short separations due to an additional mass-transfer between the first-born neutron star and a naked helium star, progenitor of the second-born neutron star. These DNSs are born with a frequency that agrees with the statistics of the r-process UFDs, and merge well within the virial radius of their host halos, therefore contributing significantly to their r-process enrichment.

title: Critical Tests Of Leading Gamma Ray Burst Theories 
authors: Shlomo Dado, Arnon Dar
topic: The two leading theoretical models of GRBs and their afterglows, the fireball model and the cannonball model, have been widely confronted with the mounting observational data on GRBs and SHBs during the last two decades. Both have claimed success in reproducing the observational data, despite their complexity and diversity. This claimed success, however, may reflect multiple choices and the use of many free adjustable parameters, rather than the true validity of the models. Only confrontation of the key falsifiable predictions of the models with solid observational data can test their validity. Such critical tests are summarized in this report. Conclusions left to the reader.

title: Nonthermal afterglow of the binary neutron star merger GW170817: a more natural modeling of electron energy distribution leads to a qualitatively different new solution
authors: Haoxiang Lin, Tomonori Totani, Kenta Kiuchi
topic: nonthermal afterglow  -- synchrotron radiation by shock-accelerated electrons. Assumption:  all electrons in the shock are accelerated as a nonthermal population, affecting the peak frequency of the afterglow spectrum. Here we present Bayesian fitting to the observed data with a more natural electron energy distribution, in which the acceleration efficiency is a free parameter. Interestingly, the maximum likelihood solutions are found with radio flux below numax in the early phase, in contrast to previous studies that found the radio frequency always above numax. The jet energy and interstellar medium density are increased by 1--2 orders of magnitude from the conventional modeling, though these are still consistent with other constraints.

authors: Jie-Shuang Wang, Fang-Kun Peng, Kinwah Wu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: We investigate emission signatures of binary compact star gravitational wave sources consisting of strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs) and/or white dwarfs (WDs) in their late-time inspiral phase. Because of electromagnetic interactions between the magnetospheres of the two compact stars, a substantial amount of energy will be extracted in the last few seconds before the two stars merge, when the binary system contains a NS with a surface magnetic field 10 to 12 gauss. The induced electric field in the process can accelerate charged particles up to the EeV energy range. Synchrotron radiation is emitted from energetic electrons, with radiative energies reaching the GeV energy for binary NSs and the MeV energy for NS - WD or double WD binaries. In addition, a blackbody component is also presented and it peaks at several to hundreds keV for binary NSs and at several keV for NS - WD or double WD binaries. The strong angular dependence of the synchrotron radiation and the isotropic nature of the blackbody radiation lead to distinguishable modulation patterns between the two emission components. If coherent curvature radiation is presented, fast radio bursts could be produced.

title: The neutron star merger GW170817 points to collapsars as the main r-process source
authors: Daniel M. Siegel, Jennifer Barnes, Brian D. Metzger
topic: Here we show that collapsar accretion disks also produce neutron-rich outflows that synthesize heavy r-process nuclei, despite the comparatively proton-rich composition of the infalling star. Though occurring less frequently than mergers, the much greater accreted mass in collapsars---and their correspondingly larger disk wind ejecta---implicate them as dominant contributors to the Galactic r-process. Collapsars provide the rare r-process source needed to promptly enrich a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies early in the Universe which is also compatible with the Galactic chemical enrichment of europium relative to iron over longer timescales. We predict an excess in the late-time near-infrared emission from GRB supernovae, testable by future observations.

authors: David Radice, Albino Perego, Kenta Hotokezaka, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Steven A. Fromm, Luke F. Roberts
topic: General-relativistic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with viscosity reveal a new outflow mechanism operating in unequal mass binaries on dynamical timescales and enabled by turbulent viscosity. These "viscous-dynamical" ejecta are launched during merger due to the thermalization of mass exchange streams between the secondary and the primary neutron star. They are characterized by asymptotic velocities extending up to 0.8c. The radioactive decay of the expanding viscous-dynamical ejecta could produce bright kilonova transients with signatures of free neutron decay in the first hour and enhanced near infrared flux on a timescale of a few days. The synchrotron remnant produced by the interaction between the ejecta and the interstellar medium could also be significantly enhanced by viscosity. Such remnant could be detected in the case of GW170817 as a rebrightening of the radio signal in the next months to years.

We examine both simple isolated dwarf disc galaxies and cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-type galaxies, and compare the (Eu/Fe) and (Eu/{\alpha}) evolution with recent observations, including the HERMES-GALAH survey. We find that neither electron-capture supernovae or neutrino-driven winds are able to adequately produce heavy neutron-capture elements such as Eu in quantities to match observations. Both neutron-star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae are able to produce these elements in sufficient quantities.

In thick disc stars, the ratio is found to be constant, while the and  ratios decrease as a function of the metallicity.  These observations clearly indicate a different nucleosynthesis history in the thick disc between Eu and Gd-Dy. We also find that the alpha-rich metal-rich stars are also enriched in r-process elements. his data may help to constrain chemical evolution models of Milky Way r- and s-process elements and the yields of massive stars.

title: Constraining the Outflow Structure of the Binary Neutron Star Merger Event GW170817 with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Analysis
authors: Yiyang Wu, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We utilize a physically motivated analytic two-parameter model called the "boosted fireball" for the outflow structure after it has expanded far from the merger site and has entered the self-similar coasting phase. This model consists of a family of outflows with a structure varying smoothly between a highly collimated ultra-relativistic jet and an isotropic fireball. We simulate the dynamical evolution, starting with "boosted fireball" initial conditions, of 240 outflows using the moving-mesh relativistic hydrodynamics code JET to follow their evolution through the afterglow phase. We compute synchrotron spectra from the hydrodynamic simulations using the standard synchrotron radiation model. We develop a synthetic light curve generator with an efficient sampling speed. Our results favor the relativistic structured jet, with a jet opening angle \sim 5 deg and Lorentz factor \sim 175, viewed from an off-axis angle of 27(+9-3) deg.

topic:  it remains unclear whether and how the central engine can produce such structured jets. Here, we utilize 3D GRMHD simulations starting with a black hole surrounded by a magnetized torus with properties typically expected of a post-merger system. We follow the jet, as it is self-consistently launched, from the scale of the compact object out to more than 3 orders of magnitude in distance. We find that this naturally results in a structured jet, which is collimated by the disk wind into a half-opening angle of roughly 10 degrees, its emission can explain features of both the prompt and afterglow emission of GRB170817A for a 30 degree observing angle. Our work is the first to compute the afterglow, in the context of a binary merger, from a relativistic magnetized jet self-consistently generated by an accreting black hole, with the jet's transverse structure determined by the accretion physics and not prescribed at any point.

We find that polarization originates from the non-homogeneous opacity distribution within the ejecta and can reach levels of 1\% at early times (1−2 days after the merger) and in the optical R band.  we constrain the observer orientation of AT 2017gfo.

title: Neutron Star Mergers Might not be the Only Source of r-Process Elements in the Milky Way
authors: Benoit Côté, Marius Eichler, Almudena Arcones, Camilla J. Hansen, Paolo Simonetti, Anna Frebel, Chris L. Fryer, Marco Pignatari, Moritz Reichert, Krzysztof Belczynski, Francesca Matteucci 
topic: We review the observational evidence that probe the properties of r-process sites, and address them using galactic chemical evolution simulations, binary population synthesis models, and nucleosynthesis calculations. Our motivation is to define which astrophysical sites have significantly contributed to the total mass of r-process elements present in our Galaxy. We found discrepancies with the neutron star (NS-NS) merger scenario. One solution is to assume an extra production site of Eu that would be active in the early universe, but would fade away with increasing metallicity. If this is correct, this extra site could be responsible for roughly 50% of the Eu production in the early universe, before the onset of Type~Ia supernovae. Rare classes of supernovae could be this additional r-process source, but hydrodynamic simulations still need to ensure the conditions for a robust r-process pattern.

title: Kilonova emission from black hole-neutron star mergers: observational signatures of anisotropic mass ejection
authors: Zhi-Qiu Huang, Liang-Duan Liu, Xiang-Yu Wang, Zi-Gao Dai
topic:  In this paper, we investigate observational signatures of kilonova emission from the anisotropic ejecta in BH-NS mergers. We find that a bump appears on the bolometric luminosity light curve due to the inhomogeneous mass distribution in the latitudinal direction. The decay slope of the single-band light curve becomes flatter and the spectrum also deviates from a single-temperature blackbody radiation spectrum due to the gradient in the velocity distribution of the ejecta. Future detection or non-detection of such signatures would be useful to test the mass ejection geometry in BH-NS mergers.

title: Delayed jet breakouts from binary neutron star mergers
authors: Tatsuya Matsumoto, Shigeo S. Kimura
topic: the jet may be choked and fails to produce a successful sGRB. We propose a "delayed breakout" scenario where a late-time jet launched by a long-term engine activity can penetrate ejecta even if a prompt jet is choked. Observationally, such a late-time jet is supported by the long-lasting high-energy emissions in sGRBs. Solving the jet propagation in ejecta, we show that a typical late-time activity easily achieves the delayed breakout.

authors: Mukul Bhattacharya, Pawan Kumar, George Smoot
topic: Here we study the effect of the BHNS binary parameters on the merger ejecta properties and associated EM signals. We estimate the remnant disk and unbound ejecta masses for BH mass and spin distributions motivated from the observations of transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and specific NS equation of state (EoS). The amount of r-process elements synthesised in BHNS mergers is estimated to be a factor 1 -- 0.01\% of the BNS.  due to the smaller dynamical ejecta and merger rates for the former. We compute the EM luminosities and light curves for the early- and late-time emissions from the ultra-relativistic jet, sub-relativistic dynamical ejecta and wind, and the mildly-relativistic cocoon for typical ejecta parameters.

title: Fingerprints of heavy element nucleosynthesis in the late-time lightcurves of kilonovae
authors: Meng-Ru Wu, Jennifer Barnes, Gabriel Martinez-Pinedo, Brian D. Metzger
topic: At early times (~days) most of the r-process heating arises from a large statistical ensemble of beta-decays, which thermalize efficiently while the ejecta is still dense, generating a heating rate that is reasonably approximated by a single power-law. However, at later times (weeks to months), the decay energy input can possibly be dominated by a discrete number of alpha-decays following the beta-decay of 225Ra which liberate more energy per decay and thermalize with greater efficiency than beta-decay products. Late-time nebular observations of kilonovae which constrain the radioactive power provide the potential to identify signatures of these individual isotopes, thus confirming the production of heavy nuclei. In order to constrain the bolometric light to the required accuracy, multi-epoch & wide-band observations are required with sensitive instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope

title: Radioactive \gamma-Ray Emissions from Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Li-Xin Li
topic: According to the theoretical model, the optical radiation from a neutron star merger originates from the radioactive decay of unstable nuclides freshly synthesized in the merger ejecta. In about a day the ejecta transits from an optically thick state to an optically thin state due to its subrelativistic expansion. Hence, we expect that about a day after the merger, the gamma-ray photons produced by radioactive decays start to escape from the ejecta and make it bright in the MeV band. In this paper, we study the features of the radioactive gamma-ray emission from a neutron star merger, including the brightness and the spectrum, and discuss the observability of the gamma-ray emission. Under favorable conditions, a prominent pair annihilation line can be present in the gamma-ray spectrum. Requires D less 12Mpc.

topic: Here, we implement empirically derived inter-correlated distributions of initial binary parameters primary mass (M1), mass ratio (q), orbital period (P), and eccentricity (e). Unexpectedly, the introduction of inter-correlated initial binary parameters leads to only a small decrease in the predicted merger rates by a factor of 2 − 3 relative to the previously used non-correlated initial distributions. The formation of compact object mergers in the isolated classical binary evolution favors initial binaries with stars of comparable masses (q = 0.5 − 1) at intermediate orbital periods (log P (days) = 2 − 4)

Here we explore some of the observational consequences of this structured emission, taking the reconstructed angular emission profile of gamma-ray burst GRB170817A to be typical. We calculate the expected fraction of gravitational-wave observations from BNS mergers that will have an observed GRB counterpart to be \sim 30\%, implying that joint gravitational-wave and GRB observations will be common. Further, we find that \sim 10% of observed short GRBs occur within 200 Mpc. Finally, we estimate a BNS merger rate of 500

title: Are fast radio bursts the most likely electromagnetic counterpart of neutron star mergers resulting in prompt collapse?
authors: Vasileios Paschalidis, Milton Ruiz
topic: Moreover, we find that most models of the BNS mass function we study here predict that the majority of prompt-collapse BNS mergers have q greater 0.8. Prompt-collapse BNS mergers with mass ratio may not be accompanied by detectable kilonovae or short gamma-ray bursts, because they unbind a negligible amount of mass and form negligibly small accretion disks onto the remnant black hole. We call such BNS mergers "orphan". Through simulations in full general relativity of BNSs endowed with an initial dipole magnetosphere, we find that the energy in the magnetosphere following black hole formation is  in 1 ms, as has been found in previous studies, matches the premerger magnetospheric luminosity. These magnetospheric signals are not beamed, and their duration and power agrees with those of non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs).

title: Physical conditions for the r-process I. radioactive energy sources of kilonovae
authors: Shinya Wanajo
topic: In previous studies power-law-type heating rates have frequently been used, which may be inadequate if the ejecta are dominated by nuclei other than the A ~ 130 region. We consider, therefore, two reference abundance distributions that match the r-process residuals to the solar abundances for A above 69 (light trans-iron plus r-process elements) and A above 90 (r-process elements). Nucleosynthetic abundances are obtained by using free-expansion models with three parameters: expansion velocity, entropy, and electron fraction. Radioactive energies are calculated as an ensemble of weighted free-expansion models that reproduce the reference abundance patterns. The results are compared with the bolometric luminosity (above a few days since merger) of the kilonova associated with GW170817. If this is the case, the event GW170817 is best explained by the production of both light trans-iron and r-process elements that originate from dynamical ejecta and subsequent disk outflows from the neutron star merger.

title: Stochastic Chemical Evolution of Galactic Subhalos and the Origin of r-Process Elements
authors: Takuya Ojima, Yuhri Ishimaru, Shinya Wanajo, Nikos Prantzos, Patrick Francois
topic: the average coalescence timescale of NSMs appears to be > 100 Myr. most of previous chemical evolution models indicate that the observed early appearance and large dispersion of [r/Fe] in Galactic halo stars at [Fe/H] less -2.5 favors shorter coalescence times of 1-10 Myr. We argue that this is not the case for the models assuming the formation of the Galactic halo from clustering of subhalos with different star formation histories as suggested by Ishimaru et al. (2015). We present a stochastic chemical evolution model of the subhalos, in which the site of the r-process is assumed to be mainly NSMs with a coalescence timescale of 100 Myr.  Our results show that the less massive subhalos evolve at lower metallicities and generate highly r-process-enhanced stars. An assembly of these subhalos leaves behind the large star-to-star scatters of [r/Fe] in the Galactic halo as observed. However, the observed scatters of [Sr/Ba] at low metallicities indicate the presence of an additional site that partially contributes to the enrichment of light neutron-capture elements such as Sr.

topic: The binary neutron star merger event GW170817 was detected through both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. Its afterglow emission may have been produced by either a narrow relativistic jet or an isotropic outflow. High spatial resolution measurements of the source size and displacement can discriminate between these scenarios. We present Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations, performed 207.4 days after the merger, using a global network of 32 radio telescopes. The apparent source size is constrained to be smaller than 2.5 milliarcseconds at the 90% confidence level. This excludes the isotropic outflow scenario, which would have produced a larger apparent size, indicating that GW170817 produced a structured relativistic jet.

authors: Rodrigo Fernández, Alexander Tchekhovskoy, Eliot Quataert, Francois Foucart, Daniel Kasen
topic: We investigate the long-term evolution of black hole accretion disks formed in neutron star mergers. These disks expel matter that contributes to an r-process kilonova, and can produce relativistic jets powering short gamma-ray bursts. Here we report the results of a three-dimensional, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of such a disk which is evolved for long enough 6s to achieve completion of mass ejection far from the disk. Our model starts with a poloidal field, and fully resolves the most unstable mode of the magnetorotational instability. We parameterize the dominant microphysics and neutrino cooling effects, and compare with axisymmetric hydrodynamic models with shear viscosity. The GRMHD model ejects mass in two ways: a prompt MHD-mediated outflow and a late-time, thermally-driven wind once the disk becomes advective. The total amount of unbound mass ejected (0.013Msun, or \approx 40\% of the initial torus mass) is twice as much as in hydrodynamic models, with higher average velocity (0.1c) and a broad electron fraction distribution with a lower average value (0.16).

authors: Ricard Ardevol-Pulpillo, H.-Thomas Janka, Oliver Just, Andreas Bauswein
topic: We present a new, computationally efficient, energy-integrated approximation for neutrino effects in hot and dense astrophysical environments such as supernova cores and compact binary mergers and their remnants. Our new method, termed ILEAS for Improved Leakage-Equilibration-Absorption Scheme, improves the lepton-number and energy losses of traditional leakage descriptions by a novel prescription of the diffusion time-scale based on a detailed energy integral of the flux-limited diffusion equation. The leakage module is supplemented by a neutrino-equilibration treatment that ensures the proper evolution of the total lepton number and medium plus neutrino energies as well as neutrino-pressure effects in the neutrino-trapping domain. Moreover, we employ a simple and straightforwardly applicable ray-tracing algorithm for including re-absorption of escaping neutrinos especially in the decoupling layer and during the transition to semi-transparent conditions. ILEAS is implemented on a three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian grid with a minimum of free and potentially case-dependent parameters and exploits the basic physics constraints that should be fulfilled in the neutrino-opaque and free-streaming limits.

topic:  Simulations of r-process nucleosynthesis, so far fail to account for the observed over-enhancement of actinides. In this work, we investigate actinide production in the dynamical ejecta of a neutron star merger and explore if varying levels of neutron richness can reproduce the actinide boost. We also investigate the sensitivity of actinide production on nuclear physics properties: fission distribution, beta-decay, and mass model. For most cases, the actinides are over-produced in our models if the initial conditions are sufficiently neutron-rich for fission cycling. We find that actinide production can be so robust in the dynamical ejecta that an additional lanthanide-rich, actinide-poor component is necessary in order to match observations of actinide-boost stars. We present a simple actinide-dilution model that folds in estimated contributions from two nucleosynthetic sites within a merger event. Our study suggests that while the dynamical ejecta of a neutron star merger is a likely production site for the formation of actinides, a significant contribution from another site or sites (e.g., the neutron star merger accretion disk wind) is required to explain abundances of r-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars.

This calculation is performed using the same EoS for merger components and for low spin prior case. It is found from the computations of tidal deformability parameters that soft to moderately stiff equations of state are allowed by the 50\% and 90\% credible regions obtained from the gravitational wave observation of binary neutron star merger GW170817, whereas the stiffest hadron-quark EoS which lies above the upper 90% limit, is ruled out. A correlation among the tidal deformabilities and masses is found to exist as already predicted. Furthermore moments of inertia and quadrupole moments of merger components of GW170817 are estimated.

We then combine the H0 values from all the galaxies to provide a final measurement of H0. We explore the dependence of our results on the thresholds by which galaxies are included in our sample, as well as the impact of weighting the galaxies by stellar mass and star-formation rate.

topic:  we investigate the dynamics, gravitational-wave emission, and nucleosynthetic yields of numerous eccentric binary neutron-star mergers having different equations of state. For each equation of state we vary the orbital properties around th we couple the dynamical ejecta output from the simulations to the nuclear-reaction network code \texttt{SkyNet} to compute nucleosynthetic yields and compare to the corresponding results in the case of a quasi-circular merger. We find that the amount and velocity of dynamically ejected material is always much larger than in the quasi-circular case, reaching maximal valuese threshold of immediate merger, as well as the binary mass ratio. At the same time, the properties of this material are rather insensitive to the details of the orbit. urthermore, while the composition of the ejected matter depends on the orbital parameters and on the equation of state, the relative nucleosynthetic yields do not, thus indicating that kilonova signatures could provide information on the orbital properties of dynamically captured neutron-star binaries.

title: The R-Process Alliance: Chemical Abundances for a Trio of R-Process-Enhanced Stars -- One Strong, One Moderate, One Mild
authors: Madelyn Cain, Anna Frebel, Maude Gull et al
topic: We present detailed chemical abundances of three new bright (V ~ 11), extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] ~ -3.0), r-process-enhanced halo red giants based on high-resolution, high-S/N Magellan/MIKE spectra. We measured abundances for 20-25 neutron-capture elements in each of our stars. All three stars show remarkable agreement with the scaled solar r-process pattern for elements above Ba, consistent with enrichment of the birth gas cloud by a neutron star merger. The abundances for Sr, Y, and Zr, however, deviate from the scaled solar pattern. This indicates that more than one distinct r-process site might be responsible for the observed neutron-capture element abundance pattern. Thorium was detected in J1432-4125 and J2005-3057. Age estimates for J1432-4125 and J2005-3057 were adopted from one of two sets of initial production ratios each by assuming the stars are old.

title: Radioactive Heating and Late Time Kilonova Light Curves
authors: Daniel Kasen, Jennifer Barnes
topic:  The luminosity of kilonova light curves depends on the efficiency with which beta-decay electrons are thermalized in the ejecta. Here we derive a simple analytic solution for thermalization by calculating how electrons accumulate in the ejecta and lose energy adiabatically and via plasma losses. We find that the time-dependent thermalization efficiency is well described by [law] is a function of the ejecta mass and velocity. For a statistical distribution of r-process isotopes with radioactive power [law] the late time kilonova luminosity asymptotes to [law] depends super-linearly on the ejecta mass [law] If a kilonova is instead powered by a single dominate isotope, we show that the late time luminosity can deviate substantially from the underlying exponential decay and eventually become brighter than the instantaneous radioactivity due to the accumulation of trapped electrons. Applied to the kilonova associated with the gravitational wave source GW170817, these results imply that a possible steepening of the observed light curve at ≳7 days is unrelated to thermalization effects and instead could mark the onset of translucency in a high opacity component of ejecta. The analytic results should be convenient for estimating the properties of observed kilonovae and assessing the potential late time detectability of future events.

title: The Location and Environments of Neutron Star Mergers in an Evolving Universe
authors: Brandon K. Wiggins, Christopher L. Fryer, Joseph M. Smidt, Dieter H. Hartmann, Nicole Lloyd-Ronning, Chris Belcynski
topic: While long-duration GRBs originate from massive stars and thus are located near their stellar nurseries, binary neutron stars may merge on much longer timescales, and thus may have had time to migrate appreciably. The strength and character of the electromagnetic afterglow emission of binary neutron star mergers is a sensitive function of the circum-merger environment. Though the explosion sites of short GRBs have been explored in the literature, the question has yet to be fully addressed in its cosmological context. We present cosmological simulations following the evolution of a galaxy cluster including star formation combined with binary population synthesis models to self-consistently track the locations and environmental gas densities of compact binary merger sites throughout the cosmic web. We present probability distributions for densities as a function of redshift and discuss model sensitivity to population synthesis model assumptions.

authors: Francois Foucart, Tanja Hinderer, Samaya Nissanke
topic: Gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals from the merger of a Neutron Star (NS) and a Black Hole (BH) are a highly anticipated discovery in extreme gravity, nuclear-, and astrophysics. We develop a simple formula that distinguishes between merger outcomes and predicts the post-merger remnant mass, validated with 75 simulations. Our formula improves on existing results by describing critical unexplored regimes: comparable masses and higher BH spins. These are important to differentiate NSNS from NSBH mergers, and to infer source physics from EM signals

title: Late afterglows of GW/GRB 170817A
authors: Houri Ziaeepour
topic: In a previous work we used a phenomenological formulation of relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission to analyse the prompt gamma-ray emission of GW/GRB 170817A. Here we use the same model to analyse late afterglows of this event. The main goal is to see whether synchrotron emission alone can explain late afterglows. This is true, if the synchrotron self-absorption of radio emission and extinction of optical/IR photons are taken into account. Alternatively, an additional source of X-ray is necessary to explain the data. These conclusions are independent of the model used here and can be deduced directly from data. We also show that at the time of its encounter with circumburst material the outflow could have been still mildly magnetized.

topic: Here we show that GRB150101B was an analogue of GRB170817A located at a cosmological distance. GRB 150101B was a faint short duration GRB characterized by a bright optical counterpart and a long-lived X-ray afterglow. These properties are unusual for standard short GRBs and are instead consistent with an explosion viewed off-axis: the optical light is produced by a luminous kilonova component, while the observed X-rays trace the GRB afterglow viewed at an angle of \sim 13 degrees. Our findings suggest that these properties could be common among future electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources.

title: Jet Dynamics in Compact Object Mergers: GW170817 Likely had a Successful Jet
authors: Paul C. Duffell, Eliot Quataert, Daniel Kasen, Hannah Klion
topic: We use relativistic hydrodynamic numerical calculations to study the interaction between a jet and a homologous outflow produced dynamically during binary neutron star mergers. We quantify how the thermal energy supplied by the jet to the ejecta and the ability of a jet to escape the homologous ejecta depend on the parameters of the jet engine and the ejecta. For collimated jets initiated at early times compared to the engine duration, we show that successful breakout of the forward cocoon shock necessitates a jet that successfully escapes the ejecta. This is because the ejecta is expanding and absorbing thermal energy, so that the forward shock from a failed jet stalls before it reaches the edge of the ejecta. This conclusion can be circumvented only for very energetic wide angle jets, with parameters that are uncomfortable given short-duration GRB observations. For successful jets, we find two regimes of jet breakout from the ejecta, early breakout on timescales shorter than the engine duration, and late breakout well after the engine shuts off. A late breakout can explain the observed delay between gravitational waves and gamma rays in GW 170817.

authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Ehud Nakar, Ore Gottlieb, Samaya Nissanke, Kento Masuda, Gregg Hallinan, Kunal P. Mooley, Adam. T. Deller
topic: In this analysis, the degeneracy in the GW signal between the source distance and the weakly constrained viewing angle dominated the H0 measurement uncertainty. ecently, Mooley et al. (2018) obtained tight constraints on the viewing angle using high angular resolution imaging of the radio counterpart of GW170817. Here we obtain a significantly improved measurement H0=68.9+4.7−4.6 km/s/Mpc by using these new radio observations, combined with the previous GW and EM data. We estimate that 15 more localized GW170817-like events (comparable signal-to-noise ratio, favorable orientation), having radio images and light curve data, will potentially bring resolution to the tension between the Planck and Cepheid-supernova measurements, as compared to 50-100 GW events without such data.

title: Elastic Scattering in General Relativistic Ray Tracing for Neutrinos
authors: M. Brett Deaton, Evan O'Connor, Y. L. Zhu, Andy Bohn, Jerred Jesse, Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, G. C. McLaughlin
topic: We present a covariant ray tracing algorithm for computing high-resolution neutrino distributions in general relativistic numerical spacetimes with hydrodynamical sources. Our formulation treats the very important effect of elastic scattering of neutrinos off of nuclei and nucleons (changing the neutrino's direction but not energy) by incorporating estimates of the background neutrino fields. Background fields provide information about the spectra and intensities of the neutrinos scattered into each ray. These background fields may be taken from a low-order moment simulation or be ignored, in which case the method reduces to a standard state-of-the-art ray tracing formulation. The method handles radiation in regimes spanning optically thick to optically thin.

title: Californium-254 and kilonova light curves
authors: Y. Zhu, R. T. Wollaeger, N. Vassh, et al
topic: We have performed dynamical nucleosynthesis calculations and identified a single isotope, 254Cf, which has a particularly high impact on the brightness of electromagnetic transients associated with mergers on the order of 15 to 250 days. This is due to the anomalously long half-life of this isotope and the efficiency of fission thermalization compared to other nuclear channels. We estimate the fission fragment yield of this nucleus and outline the astrophysical conditions under which 254Cf has the greatest impact to the light curve. Future observations in the middle-IR which are bright during this regime could indicate the production of actinide nucleosynthesis.

authors: K. P. Mooley, A. T. Deller, O. Gottlieb, E. Nakar, G. Hallinan, S. Bourke , D.A. Frail, A. Horesh, A. Corsi, K. Hotokezaka
topic: To date, various models have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a choked-jet cocoon and a successful-jet cocoon (a.k.a. structured jet). However, the observational data have remained inconclusive as to whether GW170817 launched a successful relativistic jet. Here we show, through Very Long Baseline Interferometry, that the compact radio source associated with GW170817 exhibits superluminal motion between two epochs at 75 and 230 days post-merger. This measurement breaks the degeneracy between the models and indicates that, while the early-time radio emission was powered by a wider-angle outflow (cocoon), the late-time emission was most likely dominated by an energetic and narrowly-collimated jet, with an opening angle of \less 5 degrees, and observed from a viewing angle of about 20 degrees.

title: From Nuclei to the Cosmos: Tracing Heavy-Element Production with the Oldest Stars
authors: Anna Frebel
topic: Old stars found in the Milky Way and its dwarf satellite galaxies can provide answers because they preserve clean elemental patterns of the nucleosynthesis processes that operated some 13 billion years ago. This enables the reconstruction of the chemical evolution of the elements. Here we focus on the astrophysical signatures of heavy neutron-capture elements made in the s-, i- and r-process found in old stars. A highlight is the recently discovered r-process galaxy Reticulum II that was apparently enriched by a neutron star merger. These results show that old stars in dwarf galaxies provide a novel means to constrain the astrophysical site of the r-process, ushering in much needed progress on this major outstanding question.

This technique can be used to produce reliable posterior distributions for compact object mergers with very moderate computational resources. We use a fast likelihood evaluation code based on this technique to estimate the parameters of the double neutron-star merger event GW170817 using publicly available LIGO data.

title: Radio sky maps of the GRB 170817A afterglow from simulations
authors: Jonathan Zrake, Xiaoyi Xie, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We present synthetic radio images of the GRB170817A afterglow, computed from moving-mesh hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star merger outflows. Having expanded for nearly a year, the merger remnant is expected to subtend roughly 5 milli-arcseconds (mas) on the sky, potentially resolvable by very long baseline radio imaging techniques. Any observations revealing the radio centroid to be offset from the line-of-site to the merger would be the smoking gun of a jetted outflow. We find that in both scenarios, the centroid exhibits superluminal proper motion away from the merger site at roughly 4 - 10 mas per day for at least the first 300 days. We argue that a successful strategy for differentiating among the explosion models will need to include multiple observations over the coming months - years. In particular, we find the time at which the centroid attains its maximum offset, and begins heading back toward the merger site, is considerably later if the jet was choked.

title: Unveiling the Engines of Fast Radio Bursts, Super-Luminous Supernovae, and Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Ben Margalit, Brian D. Metzger, Edo Berger, Matt Nicholl, Tarraneh Eftekhari, Raffaella Margutti
topic: However, a barrier to direct confirmation of the magnetar hypothesis is the challenge of directly observing non-thermal emission from the central engine at early times (when it is most powerful and thus detectable) due to the dense surrounding ejecta. We present CLOUDY calculations of the time-dependent evolution of the temperature and ionization structure of expanding supernova or merger ejecta due to photo-ionization by a magnetar engine, in order to study the escape of X-rays (absorbed by neutral gas) and radio waves (absorbed by ionized gas), as well as to assess the evolution of the local dispersion measure due to photo-ionization. We find that ionization breakout does not occur if the engine's ionizing luminosity decays rapidly, and that X-rays typically escape the oxygen-rich ejecta of SLSNe only on \sim 100yr timescales, consistent with current X-ray non-detections. We apply these results to constrain engine-driven models for the binary NS merger GW170817 and the luminous transient ASASSN-15lh.

title: On GW170817 and the Galactic Binary Neutron Star Population
authors: Chris Pankow
topic: Electromagnetic observations and model fitting of the ejecta properties from the subsequent kilonova detection provided values of the ejecta mass from the merger. These values, when combined with the gravitational-wave measurement disfavors an equal-mass configuration, with the level of disagreement dependent on the assumed amount of ejecta mass of dynamical origin. Within the confines of our own galaxy, several binary neutron star systems along with measurements of their component masses have been made. If those distributions are indicative of a universal distribution, the joint measurement of the component masses of GW170817 represents an outlier. This tension is not easily resolvable from physical arguments, as the proposed pathways which form binary neutron stars do not often produce very asymmetrical pairs. Even accounting for the uncertainty associated with the total mass of the dynamical ejecta, this tension suggests that the distribution of binary neutron star masses in the galaxy is not indicative of those in other galaxies.

The the current merger rates of DNSs and NSBHs  strongly depend on the assumptions on CE and natal kicks.

In this letter, we perform a 2-dimensional radiative transfer simulation for a kilonova/macronova consistently taking the interplay of multiple ejecta components into account. We show that the lightcurves and photospheric velocity of SSS17a can be reproduced naturally by a setup consistent with the prediction of the numerical-relativity simulations.

title: Constraining the Environmental Properties of FRB 131104 Using the Unified Dynamical Afterglow Model
authors: Zong-Kai Peng, Shan-Qin Wang, Liang-Duan Liu, Zi-Gao Dai, Hai Yu
topic:  In this paper, we adopt a unified afterglow model that takes into account the non-relativistic effect and jet effect and use the upper limits of four bands (5.5 GHz, 7.5 GHz, U-band, and X-ray) to obtain more stringent constraints on the parameter space spanned by \epsilon_B and n. We thus suggest that FRB 131104/Swift J0644.5-5111 might originate from a black hole-neutron star merger event. Moreover, we calculate multi-band emissions from a kilonova powered by the radioactivity of r-process elements synthesized in the ejected neutron-rich material and find that the U-band emission from the putative kilonova is significantly lower than the upper limit of the observations.

topic: We present late-time radio observations of GW170817, the first binary neutron star merger discovered through gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. Our observations, carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, were optimized to detect polarized radio emission, and thus to constrain the linear polarization fraction of GW170817. At an epoch of \sim 244 days after the merger, we rule out linearly polarized emission above a fraction of ~1\2 \% at a frequency of 2.8 GHz (99\% confidence). Within the structured jet scenario (a.k.a. successful jet plus cocoon system) for GW170817, the derived upper-limit on the radio continuum linear polarization fraction strongly constrains the magnetic field configuration in the shocked ejecta. We show that our results for GW170817 are compatible with the low level of linear polarization found in afterglows of cosmological long gamma-ray bursts. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of future expectations for the study of radio counterparts of binary neutron star mergers identified by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.

title: Evaluating radiation transport errors in merger simulations using a Monte-Carlo algorithm
authors: Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, Lawerence E. Kidder, Ronny Nguyen, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: Unfortunately, Boltzmann's equations of radiation transport remain too costly to be evolved directly in merger simulations. Simulations rely instead on approximate transport algorithms with unquantified modeling errors. In this paper, we use for the first time a time-dependent general relativistic Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm to solve Boltzmann's equations and estimate important properties of the neutrino distribution function \sim 10ms after a neutron star merger. We do not fully couple the MC algorithm to the fluid evolution, but use a short evolution of the merger remnant to critically assess errors in our approximate gray two-moment transport scheme. We demonstrate that the analytical closure used by the moment scheme is highly inaccurate in the polar regions, but performs well elsewhere. While the average energy of polar neutrinos is reasonably well captured by the two-moment scheme, estimates for the neutrino energy become less accurate at lower latitudes. The two-moment formalism also overestimates the density of neutrinos in the polar regions by \sim 50%, and underestimates the neutrino pair-annihilation rate at the poles by factors of 2-3. Although the latter is significantly more accurate than one might have expected before this study, our results indicate that predictions for the properties of polar outflows and for the creation of a baryon-free region at the poles are likely to be affected by errors in the two-moment scheme, thus limiting our ability to reliably model kilonovae and gamma-ray bursts.

We also put forward alternative strong (\sim G) magnetic field scenarios able to support this emission. For such stronger fields, the photo-disintegration of non-thermal nuclei within the source is considered, and a bottleneck period of \sim 5-30 days is found when this process peaks. We find that this class of source is in principle able to support the population of cosmic rays detected at Earth below the "ankle".

authors: Nicola Giacobbo, Michela Mapelli
topic: We investigate the impact of progenitor's metallicity, of the common-envelope parameter α and of the natal kicks on the properties of DNSs, BHNSs and BHBs. We find that neutron-star (NS) masses in DNSs span from 1.1 to 2.0 Msun, with a preference for light NSs, while NSs in merging BHNSs have mostly large masses (1.3−2.0 Msun). BHs in merging BHNSs are preferentially low mass (5−15 Msun). BH masses in merging BHBs strongly depend on the progenitor's metallicity and span from \sim 5 to \sim 45 Msun. The local merger rate density of both BHNSs and BHBs derived from our simulations is consistent with the values reported by the LVC in all our simulations. In contrast, the local merger rate density of DNSs matches the value inferred from the LVC only if low natal kicks are assumed. This result adds another piece to the intricate puzzle of natal kicks and DNS formation.

We investigate the impact of ECSNe on the formation of DNSs by means of population synthesis simulations.

Finally, we have considered the extreme case in which all neutron stars receive a low natal kick. In this case, the number of DNSs increases by a factor of ten and the percentage of merging DNSs which went through an ECSN is significantly suppressed.
