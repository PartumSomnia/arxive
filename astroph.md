title: A magnetar engine for short GRBs and kilonovae
authors: Philipp Mösta, David Radice, Roland Haas, Erik Schnetter, Sebastiano Bernuzzi
topic: We have performed dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic (GR) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of NSM remnants including a nuclear equation of state (EOS) and neutrino effects. We find that turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) amplifies magnetic fields to beyond magnetar-strength (≳1015G) and that this field is efficient in launching a relativistic jet from the magnetar. Our simulations demonstrate that magnetars formed in NSMs are a viable engine for both sGRBs and kilonova
revelation: the neutrino-driven/magnetically drivenwind can clean up the baryon pollution of the polar region prevents the launch of a sGRB jet
