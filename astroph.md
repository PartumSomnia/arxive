title: Hydrodynamical modeling of the light curves of core collapse supernovae with HYPERION. I. The mass range 13-25 Msun, the metallicities -3<=[Fe/H]<=0 and the case of SN1999em
authors: Marco Limongi, Alessandro Chieffi
topic: We present the last version of {\scshape{Hyperion}} (HYdrodynamic Ppm Explosion with Radiation diffusION), a hydrodynamic code designed to calculate the explosive nucleosynthesis, remnant mass and light curve associated to the explosion of a massive star. By means of this code we compute the explosion of a subset of red supergiant models, taken from the database published by \cite{lc18}, for various explosion energies in the range ~0.20−2.00 1051 erg. The main outcomes of these simulations, i.e., remnant mass, 56Ni synthesized, luminosity and length of the plateau of the bolometric light curve, are analyzed as a function of the initial parameters of the star (mass and metallicity) and of the explosion energy. As a first application of {\scshape{Hyperion}} we estimated the mass and the metallicity of the progenitor star of SN 1999em, a well studied SN IIP, by means of the light curve fitting.

title: The Synchrotron Polarization in Decaying Magnetic Field in Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: K.F. Cheng, X.H. Zhao, J.M. Bai
topic: Polarization can serve as a probe of the radiation mechanism and magnetic field (MF) configuration in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In the case of constant MF, the synchrotron polarization in the prompt phase of GRBs has been widely studied. In this paper, we consider the case of the decaying MF. We calculate the time-averaged and instantaneous synchrotron polarizations in a pulse for different viewing angles and for the large-scale decaying MF model, which can explain the so-called Band spectrum. We find that the on-axis time-averaged polarization degree (PD) in the energy band of 50-500 keV for the decaying large-scale MF model (~0.6 for typical parameters) is higher than that in the constant MF model (~0.5). An interesting result is the instantaneous PD in the off-axis case will experience a turnover, i.e., the PD will evolve from a positive value to a negative one. This suggests the polarization angle (PA) change by an angle of 90[deg]. Such a result is roughly consistent with the discovery of the PA evolution within a pulse in some bursts, such as GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A. Our result implies at least a part of bursts (off-axis bursts) should have the PA evolution in a pulse.

title: The Broad-band Counterpart of the Short GRB 200522A at z=0.5536: A Luminous Kilonova or a Collimated Outflow with a Reverse Shock?
authors: W. Fong (Northwestern/CIERA), T. Laskar, J. Rastinejad, A. Rouco Escorial, G. Schroeder, J. Barnes, C. D. Kilpatrick, K. Paterson, E. Berger, B. D. Metzger, et al
topic: We present the discovery of the radio afterglow and near-infrared (NIR) counterpart of the Swift short GRB 200522A, located at a small projected offset of ≈1 kpc from the center of a young, star-forming host galaxy at z=0.5536. The radio and X-ray luminosities of the afterglow are consistent with those of on-axis cosmological short GRBs. The NIR counterpart, revealed by our HST observations at a rest-frame time of approx 2.3 days, has a luminosity of sim (1.3−1.7) times 10 to the power of 42 erg s−1. This is substantially lower than on-axis short GRB afterglow detections, but is a factor of ≈8-17 more luminous than the kilonova of GW170817, and significantly more luminous than any kilonova candidate for which comparable observations exist. The combination of the counterpart's color (i−y=-0.08 pm 0.21; rest-frame) and luminosity cannot be explained by standard radioactive heating alone. We present two scenarios to interpret the broad-band behavior of GRB 200522A: a synchrotron forward shock with a luminous kilonova (potentially boosted by magnetar energy deposition), or forward and reverse shocks from alpha approx 14deg, relativistic (Gamma0 greater 80) jet. Models which include a combination of enhanced radioactive heating rates, low-lanthanide mass fractions, or additional sources of heating from late-time central engine activity may provide viable alternate explanations.

title: Monte-Carlo neutrino transport in neutron star merger simulations
authors: Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, Francois Hebert, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: Gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals from merging neutron star binaries provide valuable information about the the properties of dense matter, the formation of heavy elements, and high-energy astrophysics. To fully leverage observations of these systems, we need numerical simulations that provide reliable predictions for the properties of the matter unbound in these mergers. An important limitation of current simulations is the use of approximate methods for neutrino transport that do not converge to a solution of the transport equations as numerical resolution increases, and thus have errors that are impossible to quantify. Here, we report on a first simulation of a binary neutron star merger that directly solves the transport equations using Monte-Carlo techniques. We demonstrate that a computationally cheap Monte-Carlo transport can be implemented without ill effects from sampling noise. We apply Monte-Carlo transport to an unequal mass neutron star binary merger up to 5ms past merger, and report on the properties of the matter and neutrino outflows. Finally, we compare our results to the output of our best approximate `M1' transport scheme, demonstrating that an M1 scheme that carefully approximates the neutrino energy spectrum only leads to ~10\% uncertainty in the composition and velocity of the ejecta

title: Returning radiation in strong gravity around black holes: Reverberation from the accretion disc
authors: D.R. Wilkins, J.A. García, T. Dauser, A.C. Fabian
topic: We study reflected X-ray emission that returns to the accretion disc in the strong gravitational fields around black holes using General Relativistic ray tracing and radiative transfer calculations. Reflected X-rays that are produced when the inner regions of the disc are illuminated by the corona are subject to strong gravitational light bending, causing up to 47 per cent of the reflected emission to be returned to the disc around a rapidly spinning black hole, depending upon the scale height of the corona. The iron K line is enhanced relative to the continuum by 25 per cent, and the Compton hump by up to a factor of three. Additional light travel time between primary and secondary reflections increases the reverberation time lag measured in the iron K band by 49 per cent, while the soft X-ray lag is increased by 25 per cent and the Compton hump response time is increased by 60 per cent. Measured samples of X-ray reverberation lags are shown to be consistent with X-rays returning to the accretion disc in strong gravity. Understanding the effects of returning radiation is important in interpreting reverberation observations to probe black holes. Reflected X-rays returning to the disc can be uniquely identified by blueshifted returning iron K line photons that are Compton scattered from the inner disc, producing excess, delayed emission in the 3.5-4.5keV energy range that will be detectable with forthcoming X-ray observatories, representing a unique test of General Relativity in the strong field limit.

title: Accretion discs with non-zero central torque
authors: C. J. Nixon, J. E. Pringle
topic: We present analytical and numerical solutions for accretion discs subject to a non-zero central torque. We express this in terms of a single parameter, f, which is the ratio of outward viscous flux of angular momentum from the inner boundary to the inward advected flux of angular momentum there. The standard "accretion" disc, where the central boundary condition is zero-torque, is represented by f=0. A "decretion" disc, where the radial velocity at the inner boundary is zero, is represented by f goes to infinity. For f greater then 0 a torque is applied to the disc at the inner boundary, which feeds both angular momentum and energy into the disc. This can arise, for example, in the case of a circumbinary disc where resonances transfer energy and angular momentum from the binary to the disc orbits, or where the disc is around a rotating magnetic star which can allow the disc orbits to be accelerated outwards at the magnetospheric radius. We present steady-state solutions to the disc structure as a function of f, and for arbitrary kinematic viscosity ν.

title: Identifying black hole central engines in gamma-ray bursts
authors: Vidushi Sharma, Shabnam Iyyani, Dipankar Bhattacharya
topic: The nature of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engine still remains an enigma. Entities widely believed to be capable of powering the extreme jets are magnetars and black holes. The maximum rotational energy that is available in a millisecond magnetar to form a jet is ~10^52 erg. We identify 8 long GRBs whose jet opening angle corrected energetics of the prompt emission episode are >10^52 erg with high confidence level and therefore, their central engines are expected to be black holes. Majority of these GRBs present significant emission in sub-GeV energy range. The X-ray afterglow light curves of these bursts do not show any shallow decay behaviour such as a plateau, however, a few cases exhibit flares and multiple breaks instead of a single power-law decay. For a minimum mass of the black hole (~2 Msun), we find the efficiency of producing a jet from its rotational energy to range between 2\%-270\%. Highly energetic jets requiring high efficiencies implies that either the mass of these black holes are much larger or there are, in addition, other sources of energy which power the jet. By considering the Blandford-Znajek mechanism of jet formation, we estimate the masses of these black holes to range between ~2-60 Msun.

title: Measuring the Hubble Constant with a sample of kilonovae
authors: Michael W. Coughlin, Sarah Antier, Tim Dietrich, Ryan J. Foley, Jack Heinzel, Mattia Bulla, Nelson Christensen, David A. Coulter, Lina Issa, Nandita Khetan
topic: Kilonovae produced by the coalescence of compact binaries with at least one neutron star are promising standard sirens for an independent measurement of the Hubble constant (H0). Through their detection via follow-up of gravitational-wave (GW), short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) or optical surveys, a large sample of kilonovae (even without GW data) can be used for H0 contraints. Here, we show measurement of H0 using light curves associated with four sGRBs, assuming these are attributable to kilonovae, combined with GW170817. Including a systematic uncertainty on the models that is as large as the statistical ones, we find H0=73.8+6.3−5.8\,km s−1 Mpc−1 and H0=71.2+3.2−3.1\,km s−1 Mpc−1 for two different kilonova models that are consistent with the local and inverse-distance ladder measurements. For a given model, this measurement is about a factor of 2-3 more precise than the standard-siren measurement for GW170817 using only GWs.

title: Magnetorotational core collapse of possible GRB progenitors. III. Three-dimensional models
authors: Martin Obergaulinger (1 and 2), Miguel-Ángel Aloy
topic: We explore the influence of non-axisymmetric modes on the dynamics of the collapsed core of rotating, magnetised high-mass stars in three-dimensional simulations of a rapidly rotating star with an initial mass of MZAMS=35Msun endowed with four different pre-collapse configurations of the magnetic field, ranging from moderate to very strong field strength and including the field predicted by the stellar evolution model. The model with the weakest magnetic field achieves shock revival due to neutrino heating in a gain layer characterised by a large-scale, hydrodynamic m=1 spiral mode. Later on, the growing magnetic field of the proto neutron star launches weak outflows into the early ejecta. Their orientation follows the evolution of the rotational axis of the proto neutron star, which starts to tilt from the original orientation due to the asymmetric accretion flows impinging on its surface. The models with stronger magnetisation generate mildly relativistic, magnetically driven polar outflows propagating over a distance of 104 km within a few 100 ms. These jets are stabilised against disruptive non-axisymmetric instabilities by their fast propagation and by the shear of their toroidal magnetic field. Within the simulation times of around 1 s, the explosions reach moderate energies and the growth of the proto neutron star masses ceases at values substantially below the threshold for black hole formation, which, in combination with the high rotational energies, might suggest a possible later proto-magnetar activity.

title: Short gamma-ray bursts and the decompression of neutron star matter in tidal streams
authors: C. J. Nixon, E. R. Coughlin, J. E. Pringle
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) are generally thought to result from the merger of two neutron stars or the merger of a neutron star with a black hole. It is becoming standard practise to model these mergers with hydrodynamical simulations that employ equations of state that are derived, for example, for determining the behaviour of matter in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), and which therefore make use of the assumption that the matter is hot and in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). In this Letter we draw attention to the fact that the hydrodynamical timescale (roughly the gravitational timescale of the neutron star) may be several orders of magnitude shorter than the timescale on which such equilibrium can be re-established in the tidal debris ejected during a sGRB, and that on the initial decompression timescales the unshocked tidal ejecta may remain sufficiently cool that the employed equations of state are not appropriate for modelling the dynamics of this part of the flow. On timescales short compared with the timescale on which NSE can be (re)established, the equation of state can remain relatively stiff and thus the stream of tidal debris can remain narrow and vulnerable to gravitational instability, as has recently been suggested. These findings suggest that estimates of the type and abundances of heavy elements formed in short gamma-ray bursts need to be revisited. We suggest that the most direct method of testing the physical and dynamical properties of tidal ejecta in sGRBs will come from modelling of their light curves, which provides the cleanest source of information on the system dynamics.

title: Delta baryons and diquark formation in the cores of neutron stars
authors: German Malfatti, Milva G. Orsaria, Ignacio F. Ranea-Sandoval, Gustavo A. Contrera, Fridolin Weber
topic: We investigate the hadron-quark phase transition in cold neutron stars in light of (i) the observed limits on the maximum-mass of heavy pulsars, (ii) constraints on the tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted in binary neutron-star mergers, and (iii) mass and radius constraints derived from the observation of hot spots on neutron star observed with NICER. Special attention is directed to the possible presence of Delta(1232) baryons in neutron star matter. Our results indicate that this particle could make up a large fraction of the baryons in neutron stars and thus have a significant effect on the properties of such objects, particularly on their radii. This is partially caused by the low density appearance of Δs for a wide range of theoretically defensible sets of meson-hyperon, SU(3) ESC08 model, and meson-Delta coupling constants. The transition of hadronic matter to quark matter, treated in the 2SC+s condensation phase, is found to occur only in neutron stars very close to the mass peak.

title: Heavy elements form short and long gamma-ray bursts
authors: Daniel M. Siegel
topic: The gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo together with their electromagnetic partner facilities have transformed the modus operandi in which we seek information about the Universe. The first ever-observed neutron-star merger---GW170817---confirmed the association of short gamma-ray bursts with neutron-star mergers and the production of heavy (r-process) elements. Based on recent theoretical and observational developments, I briefly present and discuss a conjecture, namely that compact accretion disks in both short and long gamma-ray bursts synthesize most of the heavy r-process elements in the Universe. The upcoming era of multi-messenger astronomy may allow us to verify or falsify this conjecture.

title: Interpreting the X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts
with radiative losses and millisecond magnetars
authors: Nikhil Sarin, Paul D. Lasky, Gregory Ashton
topic: The spin-down energy of millisecond magnetars has been invoked to explain X-ray afterglow observations of a significant fraction of short and long gamma-ray bursts. Here, we extend models previously introduced in the literature, incorporating radiative losses with the spin down of a magnetar central engine through an arbitrary braking index. Combining this with a model for the tail of the prompt emission, we show that our model can better explain the data than millisecond-magnetar models without radiative losses or those that invoke spin down solely through vacuum dipole radiation. We find that our model predicts a subset of X-ray flares seen in some gamma-ray bursts. We can further explain the diversity of X-ray plateaus by altering the radiative efficiency and measure the braking index of newly-born millisecond magnetars. We measure the braking index of GRB061121 as n=4.85+0.11-0.15 suggesting the millisecond-magnetar born in this gamma-ray burst spins down predominantly through gravitational-wave emission.

title: A scalable random forest regressor for combining neutron-star equation of state measurements: A case study with GW170817 and GW190425
authors: Francisco Hernandez Vivanco, Rory Smith, Eric Thrane, Paul D. Lasky
topic: Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star coalescences constrain the neutron-star equation of state by enabling measurement of the tidal deformation of each neutron star. This deformation is determined by the tidal deformability parameter Λ, which was constrained using the first binary neutron star gravitational-wave observation, GW170817. Now, with the measurement of the second binary neutron star, GW190425, we can combine different gravitational-wave measurements to obtain tighter constraints on the neutron-star equation of state. In this paper, we combine data from GW170817 and GW190425 to place constraints on the neutron-star equation of state. To facilitate this calculation, we derive interpolated marginalized likelihoods for each event using a machine learning algorithm. These likelihoods, which we make publicly available, allow for results from multiple gravitational-wave signals to be easily combined.

title: The surface of rapidly-rotating neutron stars: implications to neutron star parameter estimation
authors: Hector O. Silva, George Pappas, Nicolás Yunes, Kent Yagi
topic: The Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) is currently observing the x-ray pulse profiles emitted by hot spots on the surface of rotating neutron stars allowing for an inference of their radii with unprecedented precision. A critical ingredient in the pulse profile model is an analytical formula for the oblate shape of the star. These formulas require a fitting over a large ensemble of neutron star solutions, which cover a wide set of equations of state, stellar compactnesses and rotational frequencies. However, this procedure introduces a source of systematic error, as (i) the fits do not describe perfectly the surface of all stars in the ensemble and (ii) neutron stars are described by a single equation of state, whose influence on the surface shape is averaged out during the fitting procedure. Here we perform a first study of this systematic error, finding evidence that it is subdominant relative to the statistical error in the radius inference by NICER. We also find evidence that the formula currently used by NICER can be used in the inference of the radii of rapidly rotating stars, outside of the formula's domain of validity. Moreover, we employ an accurate enthalpy-based method to locate the surface of numerical solutions of rapidly rotating neutron stars and a new highly-accurate formula to describe their surfaces.

title: Simulations of early kilonova emission from neutron star mergers
authors: Smaranika Banerjee, Masaomi Tanaka, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Daiji Kato, Gediminas Gaigalas
topic: We present radiative transfer simulations for blue kilonovae hours after neutron star (NS) mergers by performing detailed opacity calculations for the first time. We calculate atomic structures and opacities of highly ionized elements (up to the tenth ionization) with atomic number Z = 20 - 56. We find that the bound-bound transitions of heavy elements are the dominant source of the opacities in the early phase (t less 1 day after the merger), and that the ions with a half-closed electron shell provide the highest contributions. The Planck mean opacity for lanthanide-free ejecta (with electron fraction of Ye = 0.30 - 0.40) can only reach around kappa similar 0.5 - 1 cm^2 g^-1 at t = 0.1 day, whereas that increases up to kappa ~ 5 - 10 cm^2 g^-1 at t = 1 day. The spherical ejecta model with an ejecta mass of Mej = 0.05Msun gives the bolometric luminosity of similar 2 x 10^42 erg s^-1 at t similar to 0.1 day. We confirm that the existing bolometric and multi-color data of GW170817 can be naturally explained by the purely radioactive model.

authors: C. Grandorf, J. McCarty, P. Rajkumar, H. Harbin, K.H. Lee, A. Corsi, I. Bartos, Z. Marka, A. Balasubramanian, S. Marka
topic: The multi-messenger discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) and light from the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817, associated with Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 170817A and kilonova AT2017gfo, has marked the start of a new era in astrophysics. GW170817 has confirmed that binary NS mergers are progenitors of at least some short GRBs. The peculiar properties of the GRB 170817A radio afterglow, characterized by a delayed onset related to the off-axis geometry, have also demonstrated how some nearby short GRBs may not be identified as such with standard short-timescale electromagnetic follow-up observations. Building upon this new information, we performed late-time radio observations of a sample of four short GRBs with unknown redshift and no previously detected afterglow in the \textit{Swift}/BAT sample in order to identify nearby (dL less 200 Mpc) off-axis GRB candidates via their potential late-time radio signatures. We find a previously uncatalogued radio source within the error region of GRB 130626 with a 3-6 GHz flux density consistent with a NS radio flare at a distance of approx 100 Mpc. However, an origin related to a persistent radio source unrelated to the GRB cannot be excluded given the high chance of false positives in error regions as large as those considered here. Further radio follow-up observations are needed to better understand the origin of this source.

title: Magnetar giant flare origin for GRB 200415A inferred from a new scaling relation
authors: Hai-Ming Zhang, Ruo-Yu Liu, Shu-Qing Zhong, Xiang-Yu Wang
topic: Soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are mainly a Galactic population and originate from neutron stars with intense (B sim 10 power of 15 G) magnetic fields (magnetars). Occasionally (once every 30−40\,yr), a giant flare occurs with enormous intensity, displaying a short hard spike, followed by a weaker, oscillatory phase which exhibits the period of the neutron star. If the magnetar giant flares occur in nearby galaxies, they would appear as cosmic short-hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) without detecting the weak oscillatory phase. Recently, a short-hard GRB named GRB 200415A was detected, with a position coincident with the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), rasing the question whether it is a classic short GRB or a magentar giant flare. Here we show that magnetar giant flares follow a scaling relation between the spectral peak energy and the isotropic energy in. The relation can be well understood in the model that giant flares arise from the photosphere emissions of relativistically expanding fireball. GRB 200415A, together with two other candidate giant flares (GRB 051103 and GRB 070201) follow this relation, which strongly favor the giant flare origin of these GRBs. The GeV emission detected by \emph{Fermi}/LAT from GRB 200415A at 18−285s can also be explained in the giant flare scenario

title: A comparison of momentum transport models for numerical relativity
authors: Matthew D. Duez, Alexander Knight, Francois Foucart, Milad Haddadi, Jerred Jesse, Francois Hebert, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: The main problems of nonvacuum numerical relativity, compact binary mergers and stellar collapse, involve hydromagnetic instabilities and turbulent flows, so that kinetic energy at small scales have mean effects at large scale that drive the secular evolution. Notable among these effects is momentum transport. We investigate two models of this transport effect, a relativistic Navier-Stokes system and a turbulent mean stress model, that are similar to all of the prescriptions that have been attempted to date for treating subgrid effects on binary neutron star mergers and their aftermath. Our investigation involves both stability analysis and numerical experimentation on star and disk systems. We also begin the investigation of the effects of particle and heat transport on post-merger simulations. We find that correct handling of turbulent heating can be important for avoiding unphysical instabilities. Given such appropriate handling, the evolution of a differentially rotating star and the accretion rate of a disk are reassuringly insensitive to the choice of prescription. However, disk outflows can be sensitive to the choice of method, even for the same effective viscous strength. We also consider the effects of eddy diffusion in the evolution of an accretion disk and show that it can interestingly affect the composition of outflows.

authors: A. Marino, J. Malzac, M. Del Santo, S. Migliari, R. Belmont, T. Di Salvo, D. M. Russell, J. Lopez Miralles, M. Perucho, R. Iaria, L. Burderi
topic: Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of Low Mass X-ray Binaries in the hard state are determined by the emission from a jet, for frequencies up to mid-infrared, and emission from the accretion flow in the optical to X-ray range. In the last years, the flat radio-to-mid-IR spectra of Black Hole (BH) X-ray binaries was described using the internal shocks model, which assumes that the fluctuations in the velocity of the ejecta along the jet are driven by the fluctuations in the accretion flow, described by the X-ray Power Density Spectrum (PDS). In this work we attempt to apply this model for the first time to a Neutron Star (NS) LMXB, i.e. 4U 0614+091. We used the multi-wavelength data set obtained in 2006, comprising data from radio to X-ray, and applied a model which includes an irradiated disc model for the accretion flow and an updated version of the internal shocks code for the ejection. The new version of the code allows to change the geometry of the jet for the case of non-conical jets.

title: Analytic properties of electromagnetic field of binary compact stars and electromagnetic precursors to gravitational waves
authors: Tomoki Wada, Masaru Shibata, Kunihito Ioka
topic: We analytically study the properties of the electromagnetic field in vacuum around close binary compact stars containing at least one neutron star. We show that the orbital motion of the neutron star induces high multipole modes of the electromagnetic field just before the merger. These modes are superimposed to form a spiral arm configuration and its edge is found to be a likely site for magnetic reconnection. These modes also enhance the total Poynting flux from neutron star binaries by a factor of 2--4. We also indicate that the electric field induced by the orbital motion lead to a magnetosphere around binaries and estimate its plasma density, which has a different parameter dependence than Goldreich-Julian density. With these properties, we discuss possible electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events, and identify radio precursors, such as fast radio bursts, as the most promising observational targets.

title: Self-similar Evolutionary Solutions for Accreting Magneto-fluid around a Compact Object with Finite Electrical Conductivity
authors: F. Habibi, R. Pazhouhesh, M. Shaghaghian
topic: In this paper, we investigate the time evolution an accreting magneto-fluid with finite conductivity. For the case of a thin disk, the fluid equations along with Maxwell equations are derived in a simplified, one-dimensional model that neglects the latitudinal dependence of the flow. The finite electrical conductivity is taken into account for the plasma through Ohm law; however, the shear viscous stress is neglected, as well as the self-gravity of the disk. In order to solve the integrated equations that govern the dynamical behaviour of the magneto-fluid, we have used a self-similar solution. We introduce two dimensionless variables, S0 and epssilon_ρ, which show the magnitude of electrical conductivity and the density behaviour with time, respectively. The effect of each of these on the structure of the disk is studied. While the pressure is obtained simply by solving an ordinary differential equation, the density, the magnetic field, the radial velocity and the rotational velocity are presented analytically.

title: The Effects of Resolution on Black Hole Accretion Simulations of Jets
authors: Christopher J. White, Fiona Chrystal 
topic: We perform three general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole accretion designed to test how sensitive results are to grid resolution in the jet region. The cases differ only in numerics, modelling the same physical scenario of a radiatively inefficient, geometrically thick, magnetically arrested flow onto a rapidly spinning black hole. Properties inferred with the coarsest grid generally agree with those found with higher resolutions, including total jet power and its decomposition into different forms, velocity structure, nonaxisymmetric structure, and the appearance of resolved millimetre images. Some measures of variability and magnetization are sensitive to resolution. We conclude that most results obtained by limiting resolution near the jet for computational expediency should still be reliable, at least insofar as they would not be improved with a finer grid.

topic: A compact object was observed with a mass 2.50−2.67 Msun by LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations (LVC) in GW190814, which provides a great challenge to the investigations into the supranuclear matter. To study this object, properties of neutron star are systematically calculated within the latest density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) parameterizations, which are determined by the ground state properties of spherical nuclei. The maximum masses of neutron star calculated by DD-MEX and DD-LZ1 sets can be around 2.55 Msun with quite stiff equations of state generated by their strong repulsive contributions from vector potentials at high densities.

topic: Binary neutron stars (BNSs) will spend ≃10 -- 15 minutes in the band of Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors at design sensitivity. Matched-filtering of gravitational-wave (GW) data could in principle accumulate enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to identify a forthcoming event tens of seconds before the companions collide and merge. Here we report on the design and testing of an early warning gravitational-wave detection pipeline.

title: On The Development of Multidimensional Progenitor Models For Core-collapse Supernovae
authors: C. E. Fields, S. M. Couch
topic: Multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations of shell convection in massive stars suggest the development of aspherical perturbations that may be amplified during iron core-collapse. These perturbations have a crucial and qualitative impact on the delayed neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism by increasing the total stress behind the stalled shock. In this paper, we investigate the properties of a 15 \msun model evolved in 1-,2-, and 3-dimensions (3D) for the final ∼424 seconds before gravitational instability and iron core-collapse using MESA and the FLASH simulation framework. We find that just before collapse, our initially perturbed fully 3D model reaches angle-averaged convective velocity magnitudes...

title: Time dependence of advection dominated accretion flow around a rotating compact object
authors: Fahimeh Habibi
topic: Time evolution of advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) around a rotating compact object is presented. The equations of time-dependent of fluid including the Coriolis force along with the centrifugal and pressure gradient forces are derived. In this research, it is assumed that angular momentum transport is due to viscous turbulence and the {\alpha}-prescription is used for the kinematic coefficient of viscosity. Moreover, the general relativistic effects are neglected. In order to solve the equations, we have used a self-similar solution. The solutions show that the behaviour of the physical quantities in a dynamical ADAF is different from that for a steady accretion flow. Our results indicate that the physical quantities are dependent of rotation parameter which is defined as the ratio of the intrinsic angular velocity of the central body to the angular velocity of disc. Also, the effect of rotation parameter on these quantities is different for co and counter-rotating flows.

title: Modeling the Galactic Compact Binary Neutron Star Population and Studying the Double Pulsar System
authors: Nihan Pol
topic: In this dissertation, we estimate the population of different classes of BNS systems that are visible to gravitational-wave observatories. Given that no ultra-compact BNS systems have been discovered in pulsar radio surveys, we place a 95 percent confidence upper limit of ~850 and ~1100 ultra-compact neutron star--white dwarf and double neutron star (DNS) systems respectively. We show that among all of the current radio pulsar surveys, the ones at the Arecibo radio telescope have the best chance of detecting an ultra-compact BNS system. We also show that adopting a survey integration time of tint~1~min will maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, and thus, the probability of detecting an ultra-compact BNS system.

title: Magnetorotational core collapse of possible GRB progenitors. II. Formation of protomagnetars and collapsars
authors: Miguel-Ángel Aloy (1), Martin Obergaulinger 
topic: We assess the variance of the post-collapse evolution remnants of compact, massive, low-metallicity stars, under small changes in the degrees of rotation and magnetic field of selected pre-supernova cores. These stellar models are commonly considered progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts. The fate of the proto-neutron star (PNS) formed after collapse, whose mass may continuously grow due to accretion, critically depends on the poloidal magnetic field strength at bounce. Should the poloidal magnetic field be sufficiently weak, the PNS collapses to a black hole (BH) within a few seconds. Models on this evolutionary track contain promising collapsar engines. Poloidal magnetic fields smooth over large radial scales (e.g. dipolar fields) or slightly augmented with respect to the original pre-supernova core yield long-lasting PNSs. In these models, BH formation is avoided or staved off for a long time, hence, they may produce proto-magnetars (PMs). Some of our PM candidates have been run for ≲10s after core bounce, but they have not entered the Kelvin-Helmholtz phase yet.

title: Searching for the radio remnants of short duration gamma-ray bursts
authors: Roberto Ricci, Eleonora Troja, Gabriele Bruni, Tatsuya Matsumoto,
topic: Neutron star mergers produce a substantial amount of fast-moving ejecta, expanding outwardly for years after the merger. The interaction of these ejecta with the surrounding medium may produce a weak isotropic radio remnant, detectable in relatively nearby events. We use late-time radio observations of short duration gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) to constrain this model. Two samples of events were studied: four sGRBs that are possibly in the local (less 200 Mpc) universe were selected to constrain the remnant non-thermal emission from the sub-relativistic ejecta, whereas 17 sGRBs at cosmological distances were used to constrain the presence of a proto-magnetar central engine, possibly re-energezing the merger ejecta. We consider the case of GRB~170817A/GW170817, and find that in this case the early radio emission may be quenched by the jet blast-wave.

authors: Shotaro Yamasaki (HUJI), Kazumi Kashiyama (U. Tokyo), Kohta Murase (PSU)
topic: Recently, a bright coherent radio burst with millisecond duration, reminiscent of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs), was co-detected with an anomalously-hard X-ray burst from a Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. We investigate the possibility that the event was triggered by a deposition of a magnetic energy in a localized region of the magnetosphere, thereby producing a so-called trapped fireball (FB) and simultaneously launching relativistic outflows. We show that the thermal component of the X-ray burst spectrum is consistent with a trapped FB with an average temperature of a few hundred keV and a size of. Meanwhile, the non-thermal component of the X-ray burst and the coherent radio burst may arise from relativistic outflows. We calculate the dynamical evolution of the outflow, launched with an energy budget  comparable to that of the trapped FB.

title: MeV Gamma Rays from Fission: A Distinct Signature of Actinide Production in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Xilu Wang, Nicole Vassh, Trevor Sprouse, Matthew Mumpower, Ramona Vogt, Jorgen Randrup, Rebecca Surman
topic: Neutron star mergers (NSMs) are the first verified site of rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, and could emit gamma rays from the radioactive isotopes synthesized in the neutron-rich ejecta. These MeV gamma rays may provide a unique and direct probe of the NSM environment as well insight into the nature of the r process, just as observed gammas from the 56Ni radioactive decay chain provide a window into supernova nucleosynthesis. In this work, we include the photons from fission processes for the first time in estimates of the MeV gamma-ray signal expected from a NSM event. We consider NSM ejecta compositions with a range of neutron richness and find a dramatic difference in the predicted signal depending on whether or not fissioning nuclei are produced.

title: New quasi-universal relations for static and rapid rotating neutron stars
authors: Wenjie Sun, Dehua Wen, Jue Wang
topic: In the last few decades, lots of universal relations between different global physical quantities of neutron stars have been proposed to constrain the unobservable or hard to be observed properties of neutron stars. But few of them are related to the gravitational redshift or the gravitational binding energy, especially for the fast rotating neutron stars. Here we will focus on the universal relations related to these two quantities. Based on 11 equations of state (EOSs) from the predictions of microscopic nuclear many-body theories for normal or hybrid neutron stars, we proposed a set of new quasi-universal relations under three rotating cases: static, general rotating and Keplerian rotating. These new quasi-universal relations provide a potential way to constrain or estimate the unobservable or hard to be observed properties of neutron stars.

authors: Yuxi Li, Houyuan Chen, Dehua Wen, Jing Zhang
topic: Based on the distribution of tidal deformabilities and component masses of binary neutron star merger GW170817, the parametric equation of states (EOS) are employed to probe the nuclear symmetry energy and the properties of neutron star. To obtain a proper distribution of the parameters of the EOS that is consistent with the observation, Bayesian analysis is used and the constraints of causality and maximum mass are considered. From this analysis, it is found that the symmetry energy at twice the saturation density of nuclear matter can be constrained within ...

title: Magnetic Energy Release, Plasma Dynamics and Particle Acceleration during Relativistic Turbulent Magnetic Reconnection
authors: Fan Guo, Xiaocan Li, William Daughton, Hui Li, Patrick Kilian, Yi-Hsin Liu, Qile Zhang, Haocheng Zhang
topic: In strongly magnetized astrophysical plasma systems, magnetic reconnection is believed to be the primary process during which explosive energy release and particle acceleration occur, leading to significant high-energy emission. Past years have seen active development of kinetic modeling of relativistic magnetic reconnection, supporting this magnetically dominated scenario. A much less explored issue in studies of relativistic reconnection is the consequence of three-dimensional dynamics, where turbulent structures are naturally generated as various types of instabilities develop. This paper presents a series of large-scale, three-dimensional, fully-kinetic simulations of relativistic turbulent magnetic reconnection (RTMR) in positron-electron plasmas. Our simulations start from a force-free current sheet with several different modes of long wavelength magnetic field perturbations, which drive additional turbulence in the reconnection region. Because of this, the current layer breaks up and the reconnection region quickly evolves into a turbulent layer filled with coherent structures such as flux ropes and current sheets. We find that plasma dynamics in RTMR is vastly different from their 2D counterparts in many aspects.

title: Formation of disks with long-lived spiral arms from violent gravitational dynamics
authors: Francesco Sylos Labini, Luis Diego Pinto, Roberto Capuzzo-Dolcetta
topic: By means of simple dynamical experiments we study the combined effect of gravitational and gas dynamics in the evolution of an initially out-of-equilibrium, uniform and rotating massive over-density thought as in isolation. The rapid variation of the system mean field potential makes the point-like particles (PP), that interact only via Newtonian gravity, to form a quasi-stationary thick disk dominated by rotational motions surrounded by far out-of-equilibrium spiral arms. On the other side, the gas component is subjected to compression shocks and radiative cooling so to develop a much flatter disk, where rotational motions are coherent and the velocity dispersion is smaller than that of PP. Around such gaseous disk long-lived, but non-stationary, spiral arms form: these are made of gaseous particles that move coherently because have acquired a specific phase-space correlation during the gravitational collapse phase. Such a phase-space correlation represents a signature of the violent origin of the arms and implies both the motion of matter and the transfer of energy.

title: GRB 140423A: A Case of Stellar Wind to Interstellar Medium Transition in the Afterglow
authors: Long Li, Xiang-Gao Wang, WeiKang Zheng, Alexei S. Pozanenko, Alexei V. Filippenko, et al
topic: We present very early ground-based optical follow-up observations of GRB~140423A, which was discovered by \emph{Swift}/BAT and by {\it Fermi}/GBM. Its broadband afterglow was monitored by {\it Swift}/XRT and ground-based optical telescopes from T0+70.96~s to 4.8~d after the {\it Swift}/BAT trigger. This is one more case of prompt optical emission observation. The temporal and spectral joint fit of the multiwavelength light curves of GRB 140423A reveals that achromatic behavior is consistent with the external shock model including a transition from a stellar wind to the interstellar medium (ISM) and energy injection. In terms of the optical light curves, there is an onset bump in the early afterglow , with a steeper to flatter "transition" . he observed X-ray afterglow reflects an achromatic behavior, as does the optical light curve. There is no obvious evolution of the spectral energy distribution between the X-ray and optical afterglow, with an average value of the photon index, Gamma = 2. This "transition" is consistent with an external shock model having the circumburst medium transition from a wind to the ISM, by introducing a long-lasting energy injection with a Lorentz factor stratification of the ejecta.

title: The infancy of core-collapse supernova remnants
authors: Michael Gabler, Annop Wongwathanarat, Hans-Thomas Janka
topic: We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-driven supernovae (SNe) with the Prometheus-HotB code, evolving the asymmetrically expanding ejecta from shock breakout until they reach the homologous expansion phase after roughly one year. Our calculations continue the simulations for two red supergiant (RSG) and two blue supergiant (BSG) progenitors by Wongwathanarat et al., who investigated the growth of explosion asymmetries produced by hydrodynamic instabilities during the first second of the explosion and their later fragmentation by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. We focus on the late time acceleration and inflation of the ejecta caused by the heating due to the radioactive decay of 56Ni to 56Fe and by a new outward-moving shock, which forms when the reverse shock from the He/H-shell interface compresses the central part of the ejecta. The mean velocities of the iron-rich ejecta increase between 100 km/s and 350 km/s (sim 8-30\%), and the fastest one percent of the iron accelerates by up to sim 1000 km/s (sim 20-25percent). This `Ni-bubble effect', known from 1D models, accelerates the bulk of the nickel in our 3D models and causes an inflation of the initially overdense Ni-rich clumps, which leads to underdense, extended fingers, enveloped by overdense skins of compressed surrounding matter.

title: Magnetohydrodynamic waves excited by a coupling between gravitational waves and a strongly magnetized plasma in binaries of neutron stars
authors: Adam S. Gontijo, Oswaldo D. Miranda
topic: Coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNSs) is one of the sources of gravitational waves (GWs) able to be detected by ground-based interferometric detectors. The event GW170817 was the first observed in the gravitational and electromagnetic spectra, showing through this joint analysis a certain compatibility with the models of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) to explain the signature of this system. Due to the intense magnetic fields of the neutron stars, the plasma magnetosphere stays strongly magnetized and the propagation of the GW through plasma can excite magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes such as Alfvén and magnetosonic waves. The MHD modes carry energy and momentum through the plasma, suggesting a mechanism to accelerate the matter during the coalescence of the binaries, explaining some characteristics of the fireball model of the sGRBs. We present a semianalytical formalism to determine the energy transferred by the GW-MHD interaction during the inspiral phase of the stars

authors: Aaron Smith, Rahul Kannan, Benny T.-H. Tsang, Mark Vogelsberger, Ruediger Pakmor
topic: We present Arepo-MCRT, a novel Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) solver for the unstructured moving-mesh code Arepo. Our method is designed for general multiple scattering problems in both optically-thin and -thick conditions. We incorporate numerous efficiency improvements and noise reduction schemes to help overcome efficiency barriers that typically inhibit convergence. These include continuous absorption and energy deposition, photon weighting and luminosity boosting, local packet merging and splitting, path-based statistical estimators, conservative (face-centered) momentum coupling, adaptive convergence between time-steps, Implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) for thermal emission, and discrete diffusion Monte Carlo (DDMC) for unresolved scattering, including a novel advection scheme. We primarily focus on the unique aspects of our implementation and discussions of the advantages and drawbacks of our methods in various astrophysical contexts. Finally, we consider several test applications including the levitation of an optically thick layer of gas by trapped IR radiation. We find the initial acceleration phase and revitalized second wind are connected via self-regulation of the RHD coupling, such that the RHD method accuracy and simulation resolution each leave important imprints on the long-term behavior of the gas.

title: The permanent ellipticity of the neutron star in PSR J1023+0038
authors: Sudip Bhattacharyya
topic: A millisecond pulsar having an ellipticity, that is an asymmetric mass distribution around its spin-axis, could emit continuous gravitational waves, which have not been detected so far. An indirect way to infer such waves is to estimate the contribution of the waves to the spin-down rate of the pulsar. The transitional pulsar PSR J1023+0038 is ideal and unique for this purpose, because this is the only millisecond pulsar for which the spin-down rate has been measured in both accreting and non-accreting states. Here we infer, from our formalism based on the complete torque budget equations and the pulsar magnetospheric origin of observed γ-rays in the two states, that PSR J1023+0038 should emit gravitational waves due to a permanent ellipticity of the pulsar.

title: Hint of a tension between Nuclear physics and Astrophysical observations
authors: Bhaskar Biswas, Prasanta Char, Rana Nandi, Sukanta Bose
topic: Observations of neutron stars by the LIGO-Virgo and NICER collaborations have provided us reasonably precise measurements of their various macroscopic properties. In this letter, within a fully Bayesian framework, we combine them to put joint constraints on the properties of neutron stars based on an empirical parameterization of nuclear matter. These values imply a somewhat stiffer equation of state for neutron stars in comparison to those found in other studies that were based on spectral or piecewise polytropic parameterization, which are agnostic to nuclear physics constraints. This indicates a tension between nuclear physics inputs and astrophysical observations. Specifically, we show that this empirically parameterized nuclear equation of state disfavors the softness found in astrophysical observations at a statistically significant level.

title: Radiative Emission Mechanisms of Tidal Disruption Events
authors: Nathaniel Roth, Elena M. Rossi, Julian H. Krolik, Tsvi Piran, Brenna Mockler, Daniel Kasen
topic: We describe how the various outcomes of stellar tidal disruption give rise to observable radiation. We separately consider the cases where gas circularizes rapidly into an accretion disc, as well as the case when shocked debris streams provide the observable emission without having fully circularized. For the rapid circularization case, we describe how outflows, absorption by reprocessing layers, and Comptonization can cause the observed radiation to depart from that of a bare disc, possibly giving rise to the observed optical/UV emission along with soft X-rays from the disc. If, instead, most of the debris follows highly eccentric orbits for a significant time, many properties of the observed optical/UV emission can be explained by the scale of those eccentric orbits and the shocks embedded in the debris flow near orbital apocenter. In this picture, soft X-ray emission at early times results from the smaller amount of debris mass deflected into a compact accretion disc by weak shocks near the stellar pericenter. A general proposal for the near-constancy of the ultraviolet/optical color temperatures is provided, by linking it to incomplete thermalization of radiation in the atmosphere of the emitting region. We also briefly discuss the radio signals from the interaction of unbound debris and jets with the black hole environment.

title: Fast Radio Burst Breakouts from Magnetar Burst Fireballs
authors: Kunihito Ioka
topic: The recent discovery of a Mega-Jansky radio burst simultaneously with short X-ray bursts from the Galactic magnetar (strongly-magnetized neutron star (NS)) SGR 1935+2154 is a smoking gun for the hypothesis that some cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs) arise from magnetar bursts. We argue that the X-ray bursts with high temperature T∼80 keV entail an electron-positron (e plus minus) outflow from a trapped-expanding fireball, polluting the NS magnetosphere before the FRB emission. The e-(plus minus) outflow is opaque to induced Compton scatterings of FRB photons, and is strongly Compton-dragged by the X-ray bursts. Nevertheless the FRB photons can break out the e± outflow with radiation forces if the FRB emission radius is larger than a few tens of NS radii. A FRB is chocked if the FRB is weaker or X-ray bursts are stronger, possibly explaining no FRBs with giant flares and no detectable X-ray bursts with weak FRBs. We also speculate that the e (plus minus) outflow may be needed to generate FRBs, solving why the FRBs occur only with the high-T X-ray bursts. The breakout physics is important for constraining the emission mechanism and electromagnetic counterparts to future FRBs.

title: Additivity of relative magnetic helicity in finite volumes
authors: Gherardo Valori, Pascal Démoulin, Etienne Pariat, Anthony Yeates, Kostas Moraitis, Luis Linan
topic: Relative magnetic helicity is conserved by magneto-hydrodynamic evolution even in the presence of moderate resistivity. For that reason, it is often invoked as the most relevant constraint to the dynamical evolution of plasmas in complex systems, such as solar and stellar dynamos, photospheric flux emergence, solar eruptions, and relaxation processes in laboratory plasmas. However, such studies often indirectly imply that relative magnetic helicity in a given spatial domain can be algebraically split into the helicity contributions of the composing subvolumes, i.e., that it is an additive quantity. A limited number of very specific applications have shown that this is not the case. Progress in understanding the non-additivity of relative magnetic helicity requires removal of restrictive assumptions in favour of a general formalism that can be used both in theoretical investigations as well as in numerical applications. We derive the analytical gauge-invariant expression for the partition of relative magnetic helicity between contiguous finite-volumes, without any assumptions on either the shape of the volumes and interface, or the employed gauge.

authors: Giancarlo Mattia, Christian Fendt
topic: Astrophysical jets are launched from strongly magnetized systems that host an accretion disk surrounding a central object. Here we address the question how to generate the accretion disk magnetization and field structure required for jet launching. We continue our work from Paper I (Mattia & Fendt 2020a), considering a non-scalar accretion disk mean-field alpha2Omega-dynamo in the context of large scale disk-jet simulations. We now investigate a disk dynamo that follows analytical solutions of mean-field dynamo theory, essentially based only on a single parameter, the Coriolis number. We thereby confirm the anisotropy of the dynamo tensor acting in accretion disks, allowing to relate both the resistivity and mean-field dynamo to the disk turbulence. Our new model recovers previous simulations applying a purely radial initial field, while allowing for a more stable evolution for seed fields with a vertical component. We also present correlations between the strength of the disk dynamo coefficients and the dynamical parameters of the jet that is launched, and discuss their implication for observed jet quantities.

authors: Igor Andreoni, Erik C. Kool, Ana Sagues Carracedo, Mansi M. Kasliwal, Mattia Bulla, Tomas Ahumada, et al
topic: To date, no compelling kilonova has been found during optical surveys of the sky, independent of gravitational-wave triggers. In this work, we searched the first 23 months of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream for candidate kilonovae in the form of rapidly evolving transients. We combined ZTF alert queries with forced point-spread-function photometry and nightly flux stacking to increase our sensitivity to faint and fast transients. Automatic queries yielded >11,200 candidates, 24 of which passed quality checks and strict selection criteria based on a grid of kilonova models tailored for both binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers. None of the candidates in our sample was deemed a possible kilonova after thorough vetting, catalog cross-matching, and study of their color evolution. The sources that passed our selection criteria are dominated by Galactic cataclysmic variables. In addition, we identified two fast transients at high Galactic latitude, one of which is the confirmed afterglow of long-duration GRB190106A, and the other is a possible cosmological afterglow. Using a survey simulation code, we constrained the kilonova rate for a range of models including top-hat and linearly decaying light curves and synthetic light curves obtained with radiative transfer simulations.

title: High-Energy Neutrinos and Gamma-Rays from Non-Relativistic Shock-Powered Transients
authors: Ke Fang, Brian D. Metzger, Indrek Vurm, Elias Aydi, Laura Chomiuk
topic: Shock interaction has been argued to play a role in powering a range of optical transients, including supernovae (particularly the superluminous class), classical novae, stellar mergers, tidal disruption events, and fast blue optical transients. These same shocks can accelerate relativistic ions, generating high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission via hadronic pion production. The recent discovery of time-correlated optical and gamma-ray emission in classical novae has revealed the important role of radiative shocks in powering these events, enabling an unprecedented view of the properties of ion acceleration, including its efficiency and energy spectrum, under similar physical conditions to shocks in extragalactic transients. Here we introduce a model for connecting the radiated optical fluence of non-relativistic transients to their maximal neutrino and gamma-ray fluence. We apply this technique to a wide range of extragalactic transient classes in order to place limits on their contributions to the cosmological high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds.

title: MHD accretion-ejection: jets launched by a non-isotropic accretion disk dynamo. I. Validation and application of selected dynamo tensorial components
authors: Giancarlo Mattia, Christian Fendt
topic: Astrophysical jets are launched from strongly magnetized systems that host an accretion disk surrounding a central object. The origin of the jet launching magnetic field is one of the open questions for modeling the accretion-ejection process. Here we address the question how to generate the accretion disk magnetization and field structure required for jet launching. Applying the PLUTO code, we present the first resistive MHD simulations of jet launching including a non-scalar accretion disk mean-field alpha^2Omega-dynamo in the context of large scale disk-jet simulations. Essentially, we find the alpha-phi-dynamo component determining the amplification of the poloidal magnetic field, which is strictly related to the disk magnetization (and, as a consequence, to the jet speed, mass and collimation), while the αR and αθ-dynamo components trigger the formation of multiple, anti-aligned magnetic loops in the disk, with strong consequences on the stability and dynamics of the disk-jet system. In particular, such loops trigger the formation of dynamo inefficient zones, which are characterized by a weak magnetic field, and therefore a lower value of the magnetic diffusivity. The jet mass, speed and collimation are strongly affected by the formation of the dynamo inefficient zones.

We take into account the fact that a small decay rate of the symmetry-breaking field may lead to brief matter-dominated era after the transition, as the field oscillates around its minimum before decaying.  We find that a strong bubble collision signal occurs in a significant part of the parameter space, and that the modified redshift of the modes that re-enter the horizon during the matter-dominated period generates a characteristic tilted `plateau' in the spectrum.

title: Confirmed width-Eiso and width-Liso relations in GRB: comparison with the Amati and Yonetoku relations
authors: Zhao-Yang Peng, Yue Yin, Ting Li, Hui Wu, Dao-Zhou Wang
topic: In this paper, we select a sample including 141 BEST time-integrated F spectra and 145 BEST peak flux P spectra observed by the Konus-Wind with known redshift to recheck the connection between the spectral width and Eiso as well as Liso. We define six types of absolute spectral widths. It is found that all of the rest-frame absolute spectral widths are strongly positive correlated with Eiso as well as Liso for the long burst for both the F and P spectra. All of the short bursts are the outliers for width-Eiso relation and most of the short bursts are consistent with the long bursts for the width-Liso relation for both F and P spectra.

topic: We report on the gravitational wave signal computed in the context of a three-dimensional simulation of a core collapse supernova explosion of a 15 Solar mass star. The simulation was performed with our neutrino hydrodynamics code Chimera. We detail the gravitational wave strains as a function of time, for both polarizations, and discuss their physical origins. We also present the corresponding spectral signatures. Gravitational wave emission in our model has two key features: low-frequency emission (less 200 Hz) emanates from the gain layer as a result of neutrino-driven convection and the SASI and high-frequency emission (> 600 Hz) emanates from the proto-neutron star due to Ledoux convection within it. The high-frequency emission dominates the gravitational wave emission in our model and emanates largely from the convective layer itself, not from the convectively stable layer above it, due to convective overshoot. Moreover, the low-frequency emission emanates from the gain layer itself, not from the proto-neutron star, due to accretion onto it. We provide evidence of the SASI in our model and demonstrate that the peak of our low-frequency gravitational wave emission spectrum corresponds to it.

title: Magnetic fields in late-stage proto-neutron stars
authors: S. K. Lander, P. Haensel, B. Haskell, J. L. Zdunik, M. Fortin
topic: We explore the thermal and magnetic-field structure of a late-stage proto-neutron star. We find the dominant contribution to the entropy in different regions of the star, from which we build a simplified equation of state for the hot neutron star. With this, we numerically solve the stellar equilibrium equations to find a range of models, including magnetic fields and rotation up to Keplerian velocity. We argue that the equation of state is effectively barotropic for this problem. For fixed magnetic-field strength, the induced ellipticity increases with temperature; we give quantitative formulae for this. The Keplerian velocity is considerably lower for hotter stars, which may set a de-facto maximum rotation rate for non-recycled NSs well below 1 kHz. The qualitative magnetic-field structure is similar for hot and cold stars, with the poloidal field component dominating over the toroidal one; we argue this result may be universal. We show that truncating magnetic-field solutions at low multipoles leads to serious inaccuracies, especially for models with rapid rotation or a strong toroidal-field component.

title: Gravitational wave background from extreme mass ratio inspirals
authors: Matteo Bonetti, Alberto Sesana
topic: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), i.e. binary systems comprised by a compact stellar-mass object orbiting a massive black hole, are expected to be among the primary gravitational wave (GW) sources for the forthcoming LISA mission. The astrophysical processes leading to the formation of such systems still remain poorly understood, resulting into large uncertainties in the predicted cosmic rate of these sources, spanning at least three orders of magnitude. As LISA can individually resolve mostly EMRIs up to z≳1, the ensemble of signals below its detection threshold will add up incoherently forming an unresolved confusion noise, which can be formally described as a stochastic background. We perform an extensive study of this background by considering a collection of astrophysically motivated EMRI formation scenarios, spanning current uncertainties. We find that in fiducial EMRI models -- predicting hundreds of EMRI detections during mission operations -- a significant background comparable to the LISA noise emerges, affecting the performance of the instrument around 3 mHz. In extreme cases, this background can even "erase" the whole LISA sensitivity bucket in the 2-10 mHz frequency range

title: A coupled guiding center-Boris particle pusher for magnetized plasmas in compact-object magnetospheres
authors: Fabio Bacchini, Bart Ripperda, Alexander A. Philippov, Kyle Parfrey
topic: We present a novel numerical scheme for simulating the motion of relativistic charged particles in magnetospheres of compact objects, typically filled with highly magnetized collisionless plasmas. The new algorithm is based on a dynamic switch between the full system of equations of motion and a guiding center approximation. The switch between the two formulations is based on the magnetization of the plasma particles, such that the dynamics are accurately captured by the guiding center motion even when the gyro-frequency is under-resolved by the time step. For particles with a large gyro-radius, due to acceleration in, e.g., reconnecting current sheets, the algorithm adaptively switches to solve the full equations of motion instead. The new scheme is directly compatible with standard Particle-in-Cell codes, and is readily applicable in curved spacetimes via a dedicated covariant formulation.

title: Magnetic field fluctuations in anisotropic, supersonic turbulence
authors: James R. Beattie, Christoph Federrath, Amit Seta
topic: The rich structure that we observe in molecular clouds is due to the interplay between strong magnetic fields and supersonic (turbulent) velocity fluctuations. The velocity fluctuations interact with the magnetic field, causing it too to fluctuate. Using numerical simulations, we explore the nature of such magnetic field fluctuations  over a wide range of turbulent Mach numbers (i.e., from weak to strong compressibility), and Alfven Mach numbers (i.e., from strong to weak magnetic mean fields, B0) We derive a compressible quasi-static fluctuation model from the magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations and show that velocity gradients parallel to the mean magnetic field give rise to compressible modes in sub-Alfvénic flows, which prevents the flow from becoming two-dimensional, as is the case in incompressible MHD turbulence.

topic: The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) still remains a mystery, even with the increased number of discoveries in the last three years. Growing evidence suggests that some FRBs may originate from magnetars. Large, single-dish telescopes such as Arecibo Observatory (AO) and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) have the sensitivity to detect FRB~121102-like bursts at gigaparsec distances. Here we present searches using AO and GBT that aimed to find potential radio bursts at 11 sites of past γ--ray bursts that show evidence for the birth of a magnetar. We also performed a search towards GW170817, which has a merger remnant whose nature remains uncertain

title: Diverse Jet Structures Consistent with the Off-axis Afterglow of GRB 170817A
authors: Kazuya Takahashi, Kunihito Ioka
topic: The jet structure of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been controversial after the detection of GRB 170817A as the electromagnetic counterparts to the gravitational wave event GW170817. Different authors use different jet structures for calculating the afterglow light curves. We formulated a method to inversely reconstruct the jet structure uniquely from a given off-axis GRB afterglow, without assuming any functional form of the structure. By systematically applying our inversion method, we find that more diverse jet structures are consistent with the observed afterglow of GRB 170817A within errors: such as hollow-cone, spindle, Gaussian, and power-law jet structures. In addition, the total energy of the reconstructed jet is arbitrary, proportional to the ambient density n0, with keeping the same jet shape if the parameters satisfy the degeneracy combination

title: Convective turbulent viscosity acting on equilibrium tidal flows: new frequency scaling of the effective viscosity
authors: Craig D. Duguid, Adrian J. Barker, Chris A. Jones
topic: Turbulent convection is thought to act as an effective viscosity (νE) in damping tidal flows in stars and giant planets. However, the efficiency of this mechanism has long been debated, particularly in the regime of fast tides, when the tidal frequency (ω) exceeds the turnover frequency of the dominant convective eddies (ωc). We present the results of hydrodynamical simulations to study the interaction between tidal flows and convection in a small patch of a convection zone. These simulations build upon our prior work by simulating more turbulent convection in larger horizontal boxes, and here we explore a wider range of parameters.

title: Does elasticity stabilise a magnetic neutron star?
authors: Prasanta Bera, D. I. Jones, Nils Andersson
topic: The configuration of the magnetic field in the interior of a neutron star is mostly unknown from observations. Theoretical models of the interior magnetic field geometry tend to be oversimplified to avoid mathematical complexity and tend to be based on axisymmetric barotropic fluid systems. These static magnetic equilibrium configurations have been shown to be unstable on a short time scale against an infinitesimal perturbation. Given this instability, it is relevant to consider how more realistic neutron star physics affects the outcome. In particular, it makes sense to ask if elasticity, which provides an additional restoring force on the perturbations, may stabilise the system. It is well-known that the matter in the neutron star crust forms an ionic crystal. The interactions between the crystallized nuclei can generate shear stress against any applied strain. To incorporate the effect of the crust on the dynamical evolution of the perturbed equilibrium structure, we study the effect of elasticity on the instability of an axisymmetric magnetic star. In particular we determine the critical shear modulus required to prevent magnetic instability and consider the corresponding astrophysical consequences.

title: The Fate of the Merger Remnant in GW170817 and its Imprint on the Jet Structure
authors: Ariadna Murguia-Berthier, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Fabio De Colle, Agnieszka Janiuk, Stephan Rosswog, William H. Lee
topic: The first neutron star binary merger detected in gravitational waves, GW170817 and the subsequent detection of its emission across the electromagnetic spectrum showed that these systems are viable progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRB). The afterglow signal of GW170817 has been found to be consistent with a structured GRB jet seen off-axis, requiring significant amounts of relativistic material at large angles. This trait can be attributed to the interaction of the relativistic jet with the external wind medium. Here we perform numerical simulations of relativistic jets interacting with realistic wind environments in order to explore how the properties of the wind and central engine affect the structure of successful jets. We find that the angular energy distribution of the jet depends primarily on the ratio between the lifetime of the jet and the time it takes the merger remnant to collapse. We make use of these simulations to constrain the time it took for the merger remnant in GW170817 to collapse into a black hole based on the angular structure of the jet as inferred from afterglow observations. We conclude that the lifetime of the merger remnant in GW170817 was ≈0.8−0.9s, which, after collapse, triggered the formation of the jet.

authors: Peter Anninos, P. Chris Fragile
topic: We report on recent upgrades to our general relativistic radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code, Cosmos++, which expands the two-moment, M1, radiation treatment from grey to multi-frequency transport, including Doppler and gravitational frequency shifts. The solver accommodates either photon (Bose-Einstein) or neutrino (Fermi-Dirac) statistical distribution functions with absorption, emission, and elastic scattering processes. An implicit scheme is implemented to simultaneously solve the primitive inversion problem together with the radiation-matter coupling source terms, providing stability over a broad range of opacities and optical depths where the interactions terms can be stiff. We discuss our formulations and numerical methods, and validate our methods against a wide variety of test problems spanning optically thin to thick regimes in flat, weakly curved, and strongly curved spacetimes.

authors: James H. Gillanders, Stuart A. Sim, Stephen J. Smartt
topic: We present detailed spectroscopic analysis of the extraordinarily fast-evolving transient AT2018kzr. The transient's observed lightcurve showed a rapid decline rate, comparable to the kilonova AT2017gfo. We calculate a self-consistent sequence of radiative transfer models (using TARDIS) and determine that the ejecta material is dominated by intermediate-mass elements (O, Mg and Si), with a photospheric velocity of ∼12000-14500km/s. The early spectra have the unusual combination of being blue but dominated by strong FeII and FeIII absorption features. We show that this combination is only possible with a high Fe content (3.5%). This implies a high Fe/(Ni+Co) ratio.

title: Superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction in non-homogeneous neutron star interiors
authors: Marco Antonelli, Brynmor Haskell
topic: Understanding the average motion of a multitude of superfluid vortices in the interior of a neutron star is a key ingredient for most theories of pulsar glitches. In this paper we propose a kinetic approach to compute the mutual friction force that is responsible for the momentum exchange between the normal and superfluid components in a neutron star, where the mutual friction is extracted from a suitable average over the motion of many vortex lines. As a first step towards a better modelling of the repinning and depinning processes of many vortex lines in a neutron star, we consider here only straight and non-interacting vortices: we adopt a minimal model for the dynamics of an ensemble of point vortices in two dimensions immersed in a non-homogeneous medium that acts as a pinning landscape.

title: The structure of weakly-magnetized gamma-ray burst jets
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Omer Bromberg, Chandra B. Singh, Ehud Nakar
topic: The interaction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets with the dense media into which they are launched promote the growth of local hydrodynamic instabilities along the jet boundary. In a companion paper (Gottlieb2020b) we study the evolution of hydrodynamic (unmagnetized) jets, finding that mixing of jet-cocoon material gives rise to an interface layer, termed jet-cocoon interface (JCI), which contains a significant fraction of the system energy. We find that the angular structure of the jet + JCI, when they reach the homologous phase, can be approximated by a flat core (the jet) + a power-law function (the JCI) with indices that depend on the degree of mixing. In this paper we examine the effect of subdominant toroidal magnetic fields on the jet evolution and morphology. We find that weak fields can stabilize the jet against local instabilities. The suppression of the mixing diminishes the JCI and thus reshapes the jet's post-breakout structure.

topic: Determination of a magnetic field structure on a neutron star (NS) surface is an important problem of a modern astrophysics. In a presence of strong magnetic fields a thermal conductivity of a degenerate matter is anisotropic. In this paper we present 3D anisotropic heat transfer simulations in outer layers of magnetized NSs, and construct synthetic thermal light curves. We have used a different from previous works tensorial thermal conductivity coefficient of electrons, derived from the analytical solution of the Boltzmann equation by the Chapman-Enskog method. We have obtained a NS surface temperature distribution in presence of dipole-plus-quadrupole magnetic fields. We consider a case, in which magnetic axes of a dipole and quadrupole components of the magnetic field are not aligned.

title: On the maximum mass of neutron stars and GW190814
authors: Daniel A. Godzieba, David Radice, Sebastiano Bernuzzi
topic: Motivated by the recent discovery of a compact object with mass in the range 2.5−2.67M⊙ in the binary merger GW190814, we revisit the question of the maximum mass of neutron stars (NSs). We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to generate about 2 million phenomenological equations of state with and without first order phase transitions. We fix the crust equation of state and only assume causality at higher densities. We derive strict upper bounds on the maximum mass of NSs that depend on bulk properties of NSs, such as the radii and the tidal deformabilities of reference NSs. We find that the presence of a NS in GW190814 is not inconsistent with present astronomical constraints on the NS equation of state, but could be ruled out with near-future NICER and/or LIGO/Virgo observations.

title: Alfvén wave mode conversion in pulsar magnetospheres
authors: Yajie Yuan, Yuri Levin, Ashley Bransgrove, Alexander Philippov
topic: The radio emission anomaly coincident with the 2016 glitch of the Vela pulsar may be caused by a star quake that launches Alfvén waves into the magnetosphere, disturbing the original radio emitting region. To quantify the lifetime of the Alfvén waves, we investigate a possible energy loss mechanism, the conversion of Alfvénwaves into fast magnetosonic waves. Using axisymmetric force-free simulations, we follow the propagation of Alfvén waves launched from the stellar surface with small amplitude into the closed zone of a force-free dipolar pulsar magnetosphere. We observe mode conversion happening in the ideal force-free regime. The conversion efficiency during the first passage of the Alfvén wave through the equator can be large, for waves that reach large amplitudes as they travel away from the star, or propagate on the field lines passing close to the Y-point.

title: Nuclear pasta in hot and dense matter and its influence on the equation of state for astrophysical simulations
authors: Fan Ji, Jinniu Hu, Shishao Bao, Hong Shen
topic: We explore the properties of nuclear pasta appearing in supernova matter, i.e., matter at finite temperature with a fixed proton fraction. The pasta phases with a series of geometric shapes are studied using the compressible liquid-drop (CLD) model, where nuclear matter separates into a dense liquid phase of nucleons and a dilute gas phase of nucleons and α particles. The equilibrium conditions for two coexisting phases are derived by minimization of the total free energy including the surface and Coulomb contributions, which are clearly different from the Gibbs conditions for phase equilibrium due to the finite-size effects. Compared to the results considering only spherical nuclei, the inclusion of pasta phases can delay the transition to uniform matter and enlarge the region of nonuniform matter in the phase diagram. The thermodynamic quantities obtained in the present calculation with the CLD model are consistent with those in the realistic equation of state table for astrophysical simulations using the Thomas--Fermi approximation.

title: The different flavors of extragalactic jets: the role of relativistic flow deceleration
authors: P. Rossi, G. Bodo, S. Massaglia, A. Capetti
topic: We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations of relativistic (with a Lorentz factor of 10), non magnetized jets propagating in a uniform density environment, in order to study the effect of the entrainment and the consequent deceleration. Our simulations investigate the jet propagation inside the galaxy core, where, most likely, the deceleration occurs more efficiently. We compare cases with different density and pressure ratios with respect to the ambient medium finding that low density jets are efficiently decelerated and reach a quasi steady state in which, over a length of 600 jet radii, slow down from highly to sub-relativistic velocities. At the opposite, denser jets keep highly relativistic velocity over the same length. We discuss these results in relation to the Faranoff Riley (FR) radio-sources classification. We infer that lower density jets can give rise to FR 0 and FR I radio-sources, while higher density jets may be connected to FR II radio-sources.

title: Primordial black hole origin for thermal gamma-ray bursts
authors: Oscar del Barco
topic: A binary black hole (BH) astrophysical scenario where a mass-constrained primordial black hole (PBH) undergoes a spiral fall onto its heavier component (such as a supermassive black hole (SMBH)) is described as an intense gamma-ray emission event. As the infalling BH approaches the Schwarschild surface of its companion, the PBH evaporation rate becomes more strongly enhanced due to the PBH blueshifted emission towards the SMBH, until a complete evaporation occurs before reaching the central BH horizon. Accordingly, our numerically calculated PBH flux density F(nu) and nuF(nu)ν fluence spectrum show an increasing Planck-like spectral dependence consistent with the first instants of thermal-dominant gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), providing a plausible confirmation of such low-mass primordial ultracompact objects.

We apply a baseline test of this method to the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and find [large uncertanty] demonstrating the improvement on constraints when using multiple gravitational wave events. We also confirm the results of other works that adopt this method, showing that increasing the LB threshold enhances the posterior structure and slightly shifts the distribution's peak to higher H0 values.

title: Jet Propagation in Expanding Medium for Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Hamid Hamidani, Kunihito Ioka
topic: The binary neutron star (BNS) merger event GW170817 clearly shows that a BNS merger launches a short Gamma-Ray Burst (sGRB) jet. Unlike collapsars, where the ambient medium is static, in BNS mergers the jet propagates through the merger ejecta that is expanding outward at substantial velocities (∼0.2c). Here, we present semi-analytic and analytic models to solve the propagation of GRB jets through their surrounding media. We also perform a series of 2D numerical simulations of jet propagation in BNS mergers and in collapsars to test our models. Our models are consistent with numerical simulations in every aspect (the jet head radius, the cocoon's lateral width, the jet opening angle including collimation, the cocoon pressure, and the jet-cocoon morphology). The energy composition of the cocoon is found to be different depending on whether the ambient medium is expanding or not; in the case of BNS merger jets, the cocoon energy is dominated by kinetic energy, while it is dominated by internal energy in collapsars. Our model will be useful for estimating electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves.

title: Secondary component of gravitational-wave signal GW190814 as an anisotropic neutron star
authors: Zacharias Roupas
topic: The gravitational-wave signal GW190814 involves a compact object with mass (2.50−2.67)Msun within the so-called low mass gap. As yet, a general consensus on its nature, being a black hole, a neutron star or an exotic star, has not been achieved. We investigate the possibility this compact object to be an anisotropic neutron star. Anisotropies in a neutron star core arise naturally by effects such as superfluidity, hyperons, strong magnetic fields and allow the maximum mass to exceed that of the ideally isotropic stars. We consider the Krori-Barua ansatz to model an anisotropic core and constrain the equation of state with LIGO/Virgo observations GW170817 and GW190814.

title: Massive neutron stars with multiquark cores
authors: Sitthichai Pinkanjanarod, Piyabut Burikham
topic: In the core of NS, it is possible that the density and pressure become so large that the nuclear matter undergoes phase transition into a deconfined phase, consisting of quarks and gluons and their colour bound states. Even though the quark-gluon plasma has been observed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions\cite{Gyulassy, Andronic}, it is still unclear whether exotic quark matter exists inside neutron stars. Recently the result from the combination of various perturbative theoretical calculations with astronomical observations\cite{Demorest, Antoniadis} shows that (exotic) quark matter could exist inside the cores of neutron stars above 2.0 solar masses (Msun)~\cite{Annala:2019puf} However, due to the nonperturbative characteristic of interactions between quarks and gluons in the deconfined phase, perturbative QCD~(pQCD) has limitation due to the possibly large coupling of the quark-gluon soup in such dense environment. We revisit the holographic model in Ref.~\cite{bch, bhp} and implement the equation of states~(EoS) of multiquark nuclear matter interpolating from the high-density pQCD EoS and matching with the nuclear EoS known at low densities.

authors: S. Walsh, S. McBreen, A. Martin-Carrillo, T. Dauser, N. Wijers, J. Wilms, J. Schaye, D. Barret
topic: At low redshifts, the observed baryonic density falls far short of the total number of baryons predicted. Cosmological simulations suggest that these baryons reside in filamentary gas structures, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). As a result of the high temperatures of these filaments, the matter is highly ionised such that it absorbs and emits far-UV and soft X-ray photons. Athena, the proposed European Space Agency X-ray observatory, aims to detect the `missing' baryons in the WHIM up to redshifts of z=1 through absorption in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra, allowing for the study of the evolution of these large-scale structures of the Universe. This work simulates WHIM filaments in the spectra of GRB X-ray afterglows with Athena using the SImulation of X-ray TElescopes (SIXTE) framework. We investigate the feasibility of their detection with the X-IFU instrument, through O VII

topic: In this undergraduate project, f-mode oscillations in neutron stars are used to constrain the equation of state of dense matter. For the first time, a systematic investigation of the role of nuclear saturation parameters on the mode oscillations is performed. It is found that the uncertainty in the determination of effective nucleon mass plays the most significant role in controlling the f-mode frequencies. Correlations of the frequencies with astrophysical observables relevant for asteroseismology are also investigated. Future detection of f-mode frequencies could then provide a unique way of constraining nuclear empirical parameters and therefore the behaviour of dense matter.

title: Confronting GW190814 with hyperonization in dense matter and hypernuclear compact stars
authors: Armen Sedrakian, Fridolin Weber, Jia-Jie LI
topic: We examine the possibility that the light companion in the highly asymmetric binary compact object coalescence event GW190814 is a hypernuclear star. We use density functional theory with functionals that have been tuned to the properties of Lambda hypernuclei as well as astrophysical constraints placed by the masses of the most massive millisecond pulsars, the mass-radius range inferred from the NICER experiment, and the binary neutron star merger event GW170817. We compute general-relativistic static and maximally rotating Keplerian configurations of purely nucleonic and hypernuclear stars. We find that while nucleonic stars are broadly consistent with a neutron star being involved in GW190814, this would imply no new degrees of freedom in the dense matter up to 6.5 times the nuclear saturation density. Allowing for hyperonization of dense matter, we find that the maximal masses of hypernuclear stars, even for maximal rapidly rotating configurations, are inconsistent with a stellar nature interpretation of the light companion in GW190814, implying that this event involved two black holes rather than a neutron star and a black hole.

title: Structure of Quark Star: A Comparative Analysis of Bayesian Inference and Neural Network based modelling
authors: Silvia Traversi, Prasanta Char
topic: In this work, we compare two powerful parameter estimation methods namely Bayesian inference and Neural Network based learning to study the quark matter equation of state with constant speed of sound parametrization and the structure of the quark stars within the two-family scenario. We use the mass and radius estimations from several X-ray sources and also the mass and tidal deformability measurements from gravitational wave events to constrain the parameters of our model. The results found from the two methods are consistent. The predicted speed of sound is compatible with the conformal limit.

title: Anisotropic Neutron Stars Modelling: Constraints in Krori-Barua Spacetime
authors: Zacharias Roupas, Gamal G. L. Nashed
topic: Dense nuclear matter is expected to be anisotropic due to effects such as solidification, superfluidity, strong magnetic fields, hyperons, pion-condesation. Therefore an anisotropic pulsars core seems more realistic than an ideally isotropic one. We model anisotropic neutron stars working in the Krori-Barua (KB) ansatz without preassuming an equation of state. We show that the physics of general KB solutions is encapsulated in the compactness. Imposing physical and stability requirements yields a maximum allowed compactness. We further input observational data from numerous pulsars and calculate the boundary density. We focus especially on data from the LIGO/Virgo collaboration as well as recent independent measurements of mass and radius of miilisecond pulsars with white dwarf companions by the \textit{Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer} (NICER).

topic: The angular momentum transfer mechanism of pulsar glitches for over four decades now stands as standalone theory with regards to glitch sizes and inter-glitch time intervals. However, recent analyses both analytic and statistical are on the verge of suppressing the theory. In this paper, we overviewed the superfluid theory to highlight the efficacy of the angular momentum process and highlighted the theoretical and observational evidences that could not be explained by processes involving transfer of angular momentum.

title: Bao-Minh Hoang, Smadar Naoz, Kyle Kremer
authors: LIGO's third observing run (O3) has reported several neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger candidates. From a theoretical point of view, NSBH mergers have received less attention in the community than either binary black holes (BBHs), or binary neutron stars (BNSs). Here we examine single-single (sin-sin) gravitational wave (GW) captures in different types of star clusters -- galactic nuclei (GN), globular clusters (GC), and young stellar clusters (YSC) -- and compare the merger rates from this channel to other proposed merger channels in the literature. There are currently large uncertainties associated with every merger channel, making a definitive conclusion about the origin of NSBH mergers impossible. However, keeping these uncertainties in mind, we find that sin-sin GW capture is unlikely to significantly contribute to the overall NSBH merger rate. In general, it appears that isolated binary evolution in the field or in clusters, and dynamically interacting binaries in triple configurations, may result in a higher merger rate.

title: The Sound of Clearing the Throat: Gravitational Waves from a Black Hole Orbiting in a Wormhole Geometry
authors: James B. Dent, William E. Gabella, Kelly Holley-Bockelmann, Thomas W. Kephart
topic: Current ground-based gravitational wave detectors are tuned to capture the collision of compact objects such as stellar origin black holes and neutron stars; over 20 such events have been published to date. Theoretically, however, more exotic compact objects may exist, collisions of which should also generate copious gravitational waves. In this paper, we model the inspiral of a stellar mass black hole into a stable, non-spinning, traversable wormhole, and find a characteristic waveform -- an anti-chirp and/or burst -- as the black hole emerges, i.e., outspirals, into our region of the Universe. This novel waveform signature may be useful in searches for wormholes in future gravitational wave data or used to constrain possible wormhole geometries in our Universe.

title: GW190814 as a massive rapidly-rotating neutron star with exotic degrees of freedom
authors: V. Dexheimer, R.O. Gomes, T. Klähn, S. Han, M. Salinas
topic: In the context of the massive secondary object recently observed in the compact-star merger GW190814, we investigate the possibility of producing massive neutron stars from equation of state models that contain exotic degrees of freedom, such as hyperons and quarks. Our work shows that state-of-the-art relativistic mean field models can generate massive stars reaching geq 2.05 MSun, while being in good agreement with gravitational-wave events and x-ray pulsar observations, when quark vector interactions and higher-order self-vector interactions are introduced. When rapid rotation is added, our models generate stellar masses that approach, and in some cases surpass 2.5 MSun. We find that in such cases fast rotation does not necessarily suppress exotic degrees of freedom due to changes in stellar central density compared to non-rotating cases.

title: Simulating jets from a neutron star companion hours after a core collapse supernova
authors: Muhammad Akashi, Noam Soker 
topic: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore the interaction of jets that a neutron star (NS) companion to a type Ic or type Ib core collapse supernova (CCSN) launches few hours after explosion with the ejecta of the CCSN. We assume that a NS companion at 5Ro from the exploding star accretes mass from the slower inner ejecta through an accretion disk, and that the disk launches two opposite jets. Although the energy of the jets is only about one per cent of the total energy of the ejecta, it is comparable to the energy of the slower inner part of the ejecta. We find that the jets inflate one low-density hot bubble to one side of the ejecta, and that this bubble expands to influence ejecta gas up to expansion velocities of v(ej)=3500 km/s. The post-shock jets' material develops a large meridional flow and small vortexes. The boundary between the ejecta and jets' post-shock gases is unstable. The instabilities and vortexes mix jets' gas with the ejecta. We expect such a hot bubble to contribute to the light curve of CCSNe that are progenitors of binary NS systems, in particular to observers on the side of the bubble.

title: Inverse energy transfer in decaying, three dimensional, nonhelical magnetic turbulence due to magnetic reconnection
authors: Pallavi Bhat, Muni Zhou, Nuno F. Loureiro
topic: It has been recently shown numerically that there exists an inverse transfer of magnetic energy in decaying, nonhelical, magnetically dominated, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in 3-dimensions (3D). We suggest that magnetic reconnection is the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this inverse transfer. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, the inverse transfer is easily inferred to be due to smaller magnetic islands merging to form larger ones via reconnection. We find that the scaling behaviour is similar between the 2D and the 3D cases, i.e., the magnetic energy evolves as t−1, and the magnetic power spectrum follows a slope of k−2.

title: Magnetic field transport in compact binaries
authors: Nicolas Scepi, Geoffroy Lesur, Guillaume Dubus, Jonatan Jacquemin-Ide
topic: Dwarf novae (DNe) and low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) show eruptions that are thought to be due to a thermal-viscous instability in their accretion disk. These eruptions provide constraints on angular momentum transport mechanisms. We explore the idea that angular momentum transport could be controlled by the dynamical evolution of the large scale magnetic field. We study the impact of different prescriptions for the magnetic field evolution on the dynamics of the disk. This is a first step in confronting the theory of magnetic field transport with observations. We develop a version of the disk instability model that evolves the density, the temperature and the large scale vertical magnetic flux together. We take into account the accretion driven by turbulence or by a magnetized outflow. To evolve the magnetic flux, we use a toy model with physically motivated prescriptions depending mainly on the local magnetization. We find that allowing magnetic flux to be advected inwards provides the best agreement with DNe lightcurves.

authors: Paz Beniamini, Pawan Kumar
topic: Light-curve variability timescales, the small ratio of rise time of the flux to pulse duration, and the spectro-temporal correlations in the data constrain the compactness of the source and the mechanism responsible for the powerful radio emission. The constraints are strongest when radiation is produced far (less 1010cm) from the compact object. We describe different physical set-ups that can account for the observed despite having large emission radii.

title: Gravitational Waves from Neutrino Asymmetries in Core-Collapse Supernovae
authors: David Vartanyan, Adam Burrows
topic: We present a broadband spectrum of gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) sourced by neutrino emission asymmetries for a series of full 3D simulations. The associated gravitational wave strain probes the long-term secular evolution of CCSNe and small-scale turbulent activity and provides insight into the geometry of the explosion. For non-exploding models, both the neutrino luminosity and the neutrino gravitational waveform will encode information about the spiral SASI. The neutrino memory will be detectable for a wide range of progenitor masses for a galactic event. Our results can be used to guide near-future decihertz and long-baseline gravitational-wave detection programs, including aLIGO, the Einstein Telescope, and DECIGO.

title: Near-infrared emission lines trace the state-independent accretion disc wind of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070
authors: Javier Sánchez-Sierras, Teo Muñoz-Darias
topic: The black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 displayed optical P-Cyg profiles and other wind-related emission line features during the hard state of its discovery outburst. We present near-infrared (nIR) spectroscopy covering the different accretion states of the system during this event. Our 8-epoch data set (VLT/X-shooter) reveals strong variability in the properties of the nIR emission lines. This includes the presence of absorption troughs and extended emission line wings with kinetic properties that are remarkably similar to those inferred from the wind signatures observed in optical emission lines, indicating that they are most likely tracing the same accretion disc wind. Unlike the optical features, these nIR signatures are not exclusive of the hard state, as they are also witnessed across the soft state with similar observational properties. This supports the presence of a relatively steady outflow during the entire outburst of the system, and represents the first detection of an accretion disc wind in a black hole soft state at energies other than X-rays. We discuss the visibility of the wind as a function of the spectral band and the potential of nIR spectroscopy for wind studies, in particular during luminous accretion phases.

title: Gravitational-wave selection effects using neural-network classifiers
authors: Davide Gerosa, Geraint Pratten, Alberto Vecchio
topic: We present a novel machine-learning approach to estimate selection effects in gravitational-wave observations. Using techniques similar to those commonly employed in image classification and pattern recognition, we train a series of neural-network classifiers to predict the LIGO/Virgo detectability of gravitational-wave signals from compact-binary mergers. We include the effect of spin precession, higher-order modes, and multiple detectors and show that their omission, as it is common in large population studies, tends to overestimate the inferred merger rate in selected regions of the parameter space. Although here we train our classifiers using a simple signal-to-noise ratio threshold, our approach is ready to be used in conjunction with full pipeline injections, thus paving the way toward including actual distributions of astrophysical and noise triggers into gravitational-wave population analyses.

title: Can we trust MHD jump conditions for collisionless shocks?
authors: Antoine Bret
topic: When applied to compute the density jump of a shock, the standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) formalism assumes, 1) that all the upstream material passes downstream, together with the momentum and energy it carries, and 2) that pressures are isotropic. In a collisionless shock, shock accelerated particles going back and forth around the front can invalid the first assumption. In addition, an external magnetic field can sustain stable pressure anisotropies, invaliding the second assumption. It is therefore unclear whether the density jump of a collisionless shock fulfils the MHD jump or not.
Here we try to clarify this issue. A literature review is conducted on 68 articles dealing with Particle-In-Cell simulations of collisionless shocks. We analyze the factors triggering departure from the MHD density jump. In the strong field limit and for parallel shocks, the departure caused by the field saturates at a finite, negative, value. For perpendicular shocks, the departure goes to zero at small and high σ's so that we find here a departure window. The results obtained have to be checked against full 3D simulations.

title: Computational General Relativistic Force-Free Electrodynamics: II. Characterization of Numerical Diffusivity
authors: J. F. Mahlmann, M. A. Aloy, V. Mewes, P. Cerdá-Durán
topic: Scientific codes are an indispensable link between theory and experiment; in (astro-)plasma physics, such numerical tools are one window into the universe's most extreme flows of energy. The discretization of Maxwell's equations - needed to make highly magnetized (astro)physical plasma amenable to its numerical modeling - introduces numerical diffusion. It acts as a source of dissipation independent of the system's physical constituents. Understanding the numerical diffusion of scientific codes is the key to classify their reliability. It gives specific limits in which the results of numerical experiments are physical. We aim at quantifying and characterizing the numerical diffusion properties of our recently developed numerical tool for the simulation of general relativistic force-free electrodynamics, by calibrating and comparing it with other strategies found in the literature. Our code correctly models smooth waves of highly magnetized plasma. We evaluate the limits of general relativistic force-free electrodynamics in the context of current sheets and tearing mode instabilities.

title: GW190425 and GW190814: Two candidate mergers of primordial black holes from the QCD epoch
authors: Sebastien Clesse, Juan Garcia-Bellido
topic: The two recent gravitational-wave events GW190425 and GW190814 from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo have both a companion which is unexpected if originated from a neutron star or a stellar black hole, with masses: [1.6−2.5] Msun  and [2.5−2.7] Msun. The possibility that these objects are Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) is investigated. The known thermal history of the Universe predicts that the PBH formation is boosted at the time of the QCD transition, inducing a peak in their distribution at this particular mass scale, and a bump around 30−50 M⊙. We find that the merging rates inferred from GW190425 and GW190814 are consistent with PBH binaries formed by capture in dense halos or before matter-radiation equality.

topic: Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes (MAGIC) detected the gamma-ray afterglow of GRB 190114C, which can constrain microscopic parameters of the shock-heated plasma emitting non-thermal emission. Focusing on the early afterglow of this event, we numerically simulate the spectrum and multi-wavelength light curves with constant and wind-like circumstellar medium using a time-dependent code. Our results show that the electron acceleration timescale at the highest energies is likely shorter than 20 times the gyroperiod to reproduce the GeV gamma-ray flux and its spectral index reported by {\it Fermi}. This gives an interesting constraint on the acceleration efficiency for Weibel-mediated shocks.

topic: The observation of a compact object with a mass of 2.50−2.67Msun on August 14, 2019, by the LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations (LVC) has the potential to improve our understanding of the supranuclear equation of state. While the gravitational-wave analysis of the LVC suggests that GW190814 likely was a binary black hole system, the secondary component could also have been the heaviest neutron star observed to date. We use our previously derived nuclear-physics--multi-messenger astrophysics framework to address the nature of this object. Based on our findings, we determine GW190814 to be a binary black hole merger with a probability of greater 99.9\%.

Some of these are very similar to the challenges faced by many astronomers engaging in international collaboration, for example, data access policies, funding, theoretical and computational resources and workforce equity. Others, including, alerts, telescope coordination and target-of-opportunity implementation, are strongly linked to the time domain and are particularly challenging as we respond to transients.

title: Radial oscillations and gravitational wave echoes of strange stars in various equation of states
authors: Jyatsnasree Bora, Umananda Dev Goswami
topic: We study the radial oscillations of non-rotating strange stars and their characteristic echo frequencies for three Equation of States (EoSs), viz., MIT Bag model EoS, linear EoS and polytropic EoS. The frequencies of radial oscillations of these compact stars are computed for these EoSs. 22 lowest radial frequencies for each of these three EoSs have been computed. First, for each EoS, we have integrated Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations numerically to calculate the radial and pressure perturbations of strange stars. Next, the mass-radius relationships for these stars are obtained using these three EoSs. Then the radial frequencies of oscillations for these EoSs are calculated. Further, the characteristic gravitational wave echo frequencies and the repetition of echo frequencies of strange stars are computed for these EoSs. Our numerical results show that the radial frequencies and also echo frequencies vastly depend on the model and on the value of the model parameter.

title: Revisiting constraints on the maximum neutron star mass in light of GW190814
authors: Yeunhwan Lim, Anirban Bhattacharya, Jeremy W. Holt, Debdeep Pati
topic: We investigate the maximum neutron star mass based on constraints from low-energy nuclear physics, neutron star tidal deformabilities from GW170817, and simultaneous mass-radius measurements of PSR J0030+045 from NICER. Our prior distribution is based on a combination of nuclear modeling valid in the vicinity of normal nuclear densities together with the assumption of a maximally stiff equation of state at high densities. The transition density is treated as a model parameter with uniform prior. Bayesian likelihood functions involving measured neutron star tidal deformabilities and radii are subsequently used to generate equation of state posteriors. We demonstrate that a modification of the highly uncertain supra-saturation density equation of state allows for the support of 2.5−2.6Msun neutron stars without strongly modifying the properties

title: Beyond moments: relativistic Lattice-Boltzmann methods for radiative transport in computational astrophysics
authors: L. R. Weih, A. Gabbana, D. Simeoni, L. Rezzolla, S. Succi, R. Tripiccione
topic: We present a new method for the numerical solution of the radiative-transfer equation (RTE) in multidimensional scenarios commonly encountered in computational astrophysics. The method is based on the direct solution of the Boltzmann equation via an extension of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods and allows to model the evolution of the radiation field as it interacts with a background fluid, via absorption, emission, and scattering. As a first application of this method, we restrict our attention to a frequency independent (``grey'') formulation within a special-relativistic framework, which can be employed also for classical computational astrophysics. For a number of standard tests that consider the performance of the method in optically thin, optically thick and intermediate regimes with a static fluid, we show the ability of the LB method to produce accurate and convergent results matching the analytic solutions.

title: GW190814: Spin and equation of state of a neutron star companion
authors: Antonios Tsokaros, Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: Here we explore some consequences of the assumption that the secondary was a neutron star (NS). We show with concrete examples of heretofore viable equations of state (EOSs) that rapid uniform rotation is certainly adequate to explain the existence of a stable ∼2.6Msun NS for moderately stiff EOS but may not be adequate for soft EOSs. Moreover, rotation may not even be necessary for sufficiently stiff ones. In particular, several soft EOSs favored by GW170817 and with maximum spherical masses of ∼2.1Msun \textit{cannot} be invoked to explain this object as a uniformly rotating NS. Absolute upper mass limits on the maximum spherical NS derived from GW170817 immediately suggest that this unknown compact companion can be a slowly or even a nonrotating NS. Stiff EOSs that can achieve this are neither rejected nor favored by GW170817, and they are in accord with the results of NICER.

We study the temporal and angular variations of the neutrino signals and discuss the detectability of the time variations driven by the spiral Standing Accretion Shock Instability (spiral SASI) when it emerges for non-exploding models.

This signal has the best localisation of any observed gravitational wave (GW) source. and an estimated distance of ~ 240 Mpc.  Nearby galaxies within the high probability region were targeted with the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), whereas promising candidate counterparts were characterized through multi-colour photometry with the Reionization and Transients InfraRed (RATIR) and spectroscopy with the Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC). We use our optical and near-infrared limits in conjunction with the upper limits obtained by the community to constrain the possible electromagnetic counterparts associated with the merger. A gamma-ray burst seen along its jet's axis is disfavoured by the multi-wavelength dataset, whereas the presence of a burst seen at larger viewing angles is not well constrained.

topic: Because of the development of many-body theories of nuclear matter, the long-standing, open problem of the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter may be understood in the near future through the confrontation of theoretical calculations with laboratory measurements of nuclear properties \& reactions and increasingly accurate observations in astronomy. In this review, we focus on the following six aspects: 1) providing a survey of the quark mean-field (QMF) model, which consistently describes a nucleon and many-body nucleonic system from a quark potential; 2) applying QMF to both nuclear matter and neutron stars; 3) extending QMF formalism to the description of hypernuclei and hyperon matter, as well as hyperon stars; 4) exploring the hadron-quark phase transition and hybrid stars by combining the QMF model with the quark matter model characterized by the sound speed; 5) constraining interquark interactions through both the gravitational wave signals and electromagnetic signals of binary merger event GW170817; and 6) discussing further opportunities to study dense matter EOS from compact objects, such as neutron star cooling and pulsar glitches.

After presenting results of this algorithm in simple fields and comparing them to expected exact analytical solutions, we present new simulations for a rotating magnetic dipole in vacuum for a millisecond pulsar by using Deutsch solution. Particles are injected within the magnetosphere, neglecting radiation reaction, interaction among them and their feedback on the fields. Our simulations are therefore not yet fully self-consistent because Maxwell equations are not solved according to the current produced by these particles. The code highlights the symmetrical behaviour of particles of opposite charge to mass ratio q/m with respect to the north and south hemispheres.

title: The Role of Magnetic Fields in Neutrino-Driven Supernovae
authors: Bernhard Müller, Vishnu Varma
topic: We study the impact of a small-scale dynamo in core-collapse supernovae using a 3D neutrino magnetohydrodynamics simulation of a 15Msun progenitor. The weak seed field is amplified exponentially in the gain region once neutrino-driven convection develops, and remains dominated by small-scale structures. About 250ms after bounce, the field energy in the gain region reaches ~50\% of kinetic equipartition. This supports the development of a neutrino-driven explosion with modest global anisotropy, which does not occur in a corresponding model without magnetic fields. Our results suggest that magnetic fields may play a beneficial subsidiary role in neutrino-driven supernovae even without rapid progenitor rotation. Further investigation into the nature of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the supernova core is required.

authors: Taylor Jacovich, Paz Beniamini, Alexander van der Horst
topic: We present a self-consistent way of modeling synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) effects in gamma-ray burst afterglows, with and without approximated Klein-Nishina suppressed scattering. We provide an analytic approximation of our results, so that it can be incorporated into the afterglow modeling code \texttt{boxfit}, which is currently based on pure synchrotron emission. We discuss the changes in spectral shape and evolution due to SSC effects, and comment on how these changes affect physical parameters derived from broadband modeling. We show that SSC effects can have a profound impact on the shape of the X-ray light curve using simulations including these effects. This leads to data that cannot be simultaneously fit well in both the X-ray and radio bands when considering synchrotron-only fits, and an inability to recover the correct physical parameters, with some fitted parameters deviating orders of magnitude from the simulated input parameters. This may have a significant impact on the physical parameter distributions based on previous broadband modeling efforts.

In GW observations, redshift identification for each GW source is a challenging issue, in particular, for high redshift sources. The use of observed luminosity distance as a distance indicator will be a simple yet optimal way for measuring the clustering signal. We derive the density fluctuations of GW sources estimated from observed luminosity distance and sky position of each source. The density fluctuations are distorted as similar to the so-called redshift space distortions in galaxy surveys but with several differences. We then show the two-point correlation function and multipole power spectrum in the presence of the distortion effect.

title: The Equation of State of Nuclear Matter : from Finite Nuclei to Neutron Stars
authors: G. F. Burgio, I. Vidana (
topic: We investigate possible correlations between neutron star observables and properties of atomic nuclei. Particularly, we explore how the tidal deformability of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star, M1.4, and the neutron skin thickness of 48Ca and 208Pb are related to the stellar radius and the stiffness of the symmetry energy. {\it Methods.} We examine a large set of nuclear equations of state based on phenomenological models (Skyrme, NLWM, DDM) and {\it ab-initio} theoretical methods (BBG, Dirac-Brueckner, Variational, Quantum Monte Carlo). {\it Results.} We find strong correlations between tidal deformability and NS radius, whereas a weaker correlation does exist with the stiffness of the symmetry energy.

topic: The discovery of a radioactively powered kilonova associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817 was the first - and still only - confirmed electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational-wave event. However, observations of late-time electromagnetic emission are in tension with the expectations from standard neutron-star merger models. Although the large measured ejecta mass is potentially explained by a progenitor system that is asymmetric in terms of the stellar component masses, i.e. with a mass ratio q of 0.7-0.8, the known Galactic population of merging double neutron star (DNS) systems (i.e. those that will coalesce within billions of years or less) has, until now, only consisted of nearly equal-mass (q>0.9) binaries.  Based on this detection, our population synthesis analysis implies that such asymmetric binaries represent between..

title: Is GW170817 a Multimessenger Neutron Star-Primordial Black Hole Merger?
authors: Yu-Dai Tsai, Antonella Palmese, Stefano Profumo, Tesla Jeltema
topic: We investigate the possibility of the gravitational-wave event GW170817 being a light, solar-mass black hole (BH) - neutron star (NS) merger. We explore two exotic scenarios involving primordial black holes (PBH) that could produce such an event, taking into account available observational information on NGC 4993. First, we entertain the possibility of dynamical NS-PBH binary formation where a solar-mass PBH and a NS form a binary through gravitational interaction. We find that while dynamical NS-PBH formation could account for the GW170817 event, the rate is highly dependent on unknown density contrast factors and could potentially be affected by galaxy mergers.

topic:Is the secondary component of GW190814 the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system? This is the central question animating this letter. Covariant density functional theory provides a unique framework to investigate both the properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars, while enforcing causality at all densities. By tuning existing energy density functionals we were able to: (a) account for a 2.6 Msun neutron star, (b) satisfy the original constraint on the tidal deformability of a 1.4 Msun neutron star, and (c) reproduce ground-state properties of finite nuclei.

Neutron star mergers are expected to often produce rapidly-rotating remnant neutron stars that emit gravitational waves. These will provide clues to the extremely hot post-merger environment. This signature of nuclear matter in gravitational waves contains most information in the 2-4 kHz frequency band, which is outside of the most sensitive band of current detectors. We present the design concept and science case for a neutron star extreme matter observatory (NEMO): a gravitational-wave interferometer optimized to study nuclear physics with merging neutron stars.

authors: Egor Podlesnyi, Timur Dzhatdoev
topic: The gravitational-wave event S190521g -- a likely binary black hole merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus -- was accompanied by an optical counterpart. Such dense environments around luminous energy release regions are favourable for high energy gamma-ray production. We report on a search for high energy gamma-rays from the direction of the candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the S190521g event using publicly-available data of the Fermi-LAT space gamma-ray telescope. No significant signal was found. We present upper limits on the spectral energy distribution of the source in the 100 MeV -- 300 GeV energy range. We discuss the importance of studying S190521g-like transients in the context of cosmic ray acceleration, gamma-ray and neutrino production in such sources.

title: RAPTOR II: Polarized radiative transfer in curved spacetime
authors: Thomas Bronzwaer, Ziri Younsi, Jordy Davelaar, Heino Falcke
topic: Accreting supermassive black holes are sources of polarized radiation that propagates through highly curved spacetime before reaching the observer. In order to help interpret observations of such polarized emission, accurate and efficient numerical schemes for polarized radiative transfer in curved spacetime are needed. In this manuscript we extend our publicly available radiative transfer code RAPTOR to include polarization. We provide a brief review of different codes and methods for covariant polarized radiative transfer available in the literature and existing codes, and present an efficient new scheme. For the spacetime-propagation aspect of the computation, we develop a compact, Lorentz-invariant representation of a polarized ray. For the plasma-propagation aspect of the computation, we perform a formal analysis of the stiffness of the polarized radiative-transfer equation with respect to our explicit integrator, and develop a hybrid integration scheme that switches to an implicit integrator in case of stiffness, in order to solve the equation with optimal speed and accuracy for all possible values of the local optical/Faraday thickness of the plasma.

title: Why can hadronic stars convert into strange quark stars with larger radii
authors: Alessandro Drago, Giuseppe Pagliara
topic: The total binding energy of compact stars is the sum of the gravitational binding energy (BE)g and the nuclear binding energy (BE)n, the last being related to the microphysics of the interactions. While the first is positive (binding) both for hadronic stars and for strange quark stars, the second is large and negative for hadronic stars (anti-binding) and either small and negative (anti-binding) or positive (binding) for strange quark stars. A hadronic star can convert into a strange quark star with a larger radius because the consequent reduction of (BE)g is over-compensated by the large increase in (BE)n. Thus, the total binding energy increases due to the conversion and the process is exothermic.

title: Wind-powered afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: flares, plateaus and steep decays
authors: 
topic: Afterglows of gamma-ray bursts often show flares, plateaus, and sudden intensity drops: these temporal features are difficult to explain as coming from the forward shock. We calculate radiative properties of early GRB afterglows with the dominant contribution from the reverse shock (RS) propagating in an ultra-relativistic (pulsar-like) wind produced by the long-lasting central engine. RS emission occurs in the fast cooling regime - this ensures high radiative efficiency and allows fast intensity variations. We demonstrate that: (i) mild wind power, of the order of ∼1046 erg s−1, can reproduce the afterglows' plateau phase; (ii) termination of the wind can produce sudden steep decays; (iii) mild variations in the wind luminosity can produce short-duration afterglow flares.

title: Turbulent, pinned superfluids in neutron stars and pulsar glitch recoveries
authors: Brynmor Haskell, Danai Antonopoulou, Carlo Barenghi
topic: Pulsar glitches offer an insight into the dynamics of superfluids in the high density interior of a neutron star. To model these phenomena, however, one needs to have an understanding of the dynamics of a turbulent array of superfluid vortices moving through a pinning lattice. In this paper we develop a theoretical approach to describe vortex mediated mutual friction in a pinned, turbulent and rotating superfluid. Our model is then applied to the study of the post glitch rotational evolution in the Vela pulsar and in PSR J0537-6910. We show that in both cases a turbulent model fits the evolution of the spin frequency derivative better than a laminar one. We also predict that the second derivative of the frequency after a glitch should be correlated with the waiting time since the previous glitch, which we find to be consistent with observational data for these pulsars. The main conclusion of this paper is that in the post-glitch rotational evolution of these two pulsars we are most likely observing the response to the glitch of a pinned turbulent region of the star (possibly the crust) and not the laminar response of a regular straight vortex array.

title: The mass, spin and rotational energy of the remnant black holes from compact binary mergers
authors: Can-Min Deng
topic: Recently, many gravitational wave events from compact binary mergers have been detected by LIGO. Determining the final mass and spin of the remnant black holes (RBHs) is a fundamental issue and is also important in astrophysics. In this paper, unified models for predicting the final mass and spin of the RBHs from compact binary mergers is proposed. The models achieve a good accuracy within the parameter range of interest. In addition, the rotational energy of the RBHs is also studied which is relevant to the electromagnetic counterparts of the mergers. It is found the distribution of the rotational energy of the RBHs from different types of mergers of compact binary has its own characteristics, which might help identify the electromagnetic counterparts associated with the mergers.

title: GW190814's secondary component with mass (2.50-2.67) Msun as a super-fast pulsar
authors: Nai-Bo Zhang, Bao-An Li
topic: Using Stergioulas's RNS code for investigating fast pulsars with Equation of States (EOSs) on the causality surface (where the speed of sound equals to that of light) of the high-density EOS parameter space satisfying all known constraints from both nuclear physics and astrophysics, we show that the GW190814's secondary component of mass (2.50−2.67) Msun can be a super-fast pulsar spinning faster than 971 Hz about 42\% below its Kepler frequency. There is a large and physically allowed EOS parameter space below the causality surface where pulsars heavier than 2.50 Msun are supported if they can rotate even faster with critical frequencies depending strongly on the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy.

title: Nickel clumps and light curve bumps: Light curves and spectra of models with macroscopic 56Ni clumps in the outer ejecta
authors: M. R. Magee, K. Maguire
topic: An excess of flux in the early light curves of type Ia supernovae has been observed in a few cases. Multiple scenarios have been proposed to explain this. Recently, it has been shown that for at least one object (SN 2018oh) the excess emission observed could be the result of a large-scale clump of 56Ni in the outer ejecta of ~0.03 Msun. We present model light curves and spectra for ejecta profiles containing 56Ni clumps of varying masses (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 Msun) and shapes. We find that even for our lowest mass 56Ni clump, an increase of less of eq 2 magnitudes is produced in the bolometric light curve at one day after explosion, relative to models without a 56Ni clump.

Making use of existing experimental nuclear data, we estimate the maximum possible amount of heat that can be deposited in the outer crust of an accreting neutron star due to electron captures and pycnonuclear fusion reactions triggered by the burial of X-ray burst ashes.

authors: Denis Nikolaevich Sob'yanin 
topic: We show that consideration of forced precession of a neutron star does not encounter the difficulty. This kind of precession takes place even if the neutron star is not deformed and is brought about by the anomalous moment of electromagnetic forces induced by stellar rotation and determined by non-corotational currents. Contrary to what is expected for the currents of corotation, the anomalous torque calculated by the direct method appears to be non-zero.

title: Discriminating between Neutron Stars and Black Holes with Imperfect Knowledge of the Maximum Neutron Star Mass
authors: Reed Essick, Philipe Landry
topic: Constructing an explicit mixture model for the total rate density of merging compact objects, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian analysis to classify gravitational-wave sources according to the posterior odds that their component masses are drawn from different subpopulations. Accounting for current uncertainty in the maximum neutron star mass, and adopting different reasonable models for the total rate density, we examine two recent events from the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration's third observing run, GW190425 and GW190814. For population models with no overlap between the neutron star and black hole mass distributions, we typically find that there is a more or equal 70 \% chance that GW190425 was a binary neutron star merger rather than a neutron-star--black-hole merger.

authors: Hou-Jun Lü, Yong Yuan, Lin Lan, Bin-Bin Zhang, Jin-Hang Zou, Zong-Kai Peng, Jun Shen, Yun-Feng Liang, Xiang-Gao Wang, En-Wei Liang
topic: Together with the EE component and early X-ray data, it exhibits a plateau emission smoothly connected with a \sim t^-1 segment, and followed by an extremely steep decay. The short GRB composed of those three segments is unique in the {\em Swift} era, and is very difficult to explain with the standard internal/external shock model of a black hole central engine, but could be consistent with the prediction of a magnetar central engine from the merger of an NS binary. We suggest that the plateau emission followed by a \sim t^-1 decay phase is powered by the spin-down of millisecond magnetar, which loses its rotation energy via GW quadrupole radiation. Then, the abrupt drop decay is caused by magnetar collapsing into black hole before switching to the EM-dominated emission.

title: Two temperature solutions and emergent spectra from relativistic accretion discs around black holes
authors: Shilpa Sarkar, Indranil Chattopadhyay, Philippe Laurent
topic: An accreting system in two-temperature regime, admits multiple solutions for the same set of constants of motion, producing widely different spectra. Comparing observed spectrum with that derived from a randomly chosen accretion solution, will give us a wrong estimation of the accretion parameters of the system. The form of entropy measure obtained by us, have helped in removing the degeneracy of the solutions, allowing us to understand the physics of the system, shorn of arbitrary assumptions. In this work, we have shown how the spectra and luminosities of an accreting system depends on the constants of motion, producing solutions ranging from radiatively inefficient flows to luminous flows. Increase in BH mass quantitatively changes the system, makes the system more luminous and the spectral bandwidth also increases. Higher BH mass system spans from radio to gamma-rays. However, increasing the accretion rate around a BH of certain mass, has little influence in the frequency range of the spectra.

In this data release, we propose a new delineation between the r-I and r-II stellar classes. Redefining the separation between r-I and r-II stars will aid in analysis of the possible progenitors of these two classes of stars and whether these signatures arise from separate astrophysical sources at all. Applying this redefinition to previous RPA data, the number of identified r-II and r-I stars changes to 51 and 121, respectively, from the initial set of data releases published thus far.

title: FIRST J1419+3940 as the First Observed Radio Flare from a Neutron Star Merger
authors: K.H. Lee, I. Bartos, G.C. Privon, J.C. Rose, P. Torrey
topic: During their violent merger, two neutron stars can shed a few percent of their mass. As this ejecta expands, it collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, producing a slowly-fading {\it radio flare} that lasts for years. Radio flares uniquely probe the neutron star merger populations as many events from past decades could still be detectable. Nonetheless, no radio flare observation has been reported to date. Here we show that the radio transient FIRST J1419+3940, first observed in 1993 and still detectable, likely originated from a neutron star merger. We carry out numerical simulations of neutron star merger ejecta to demonstrate that the observed radio light curve is well reproduced by a merger model with astrophysically expected parameters. We find that a neutron star merger model is a priori more likely and provides a better fit to the data than the alternative explanation---the afterglow of an off-axis long gamma-ray burst.

title: Post-merger Mass Ejection of Low-mass Binary Neutron Stars
authors: Sho Fujibayashi, Shinya Wanajo, Kenta Kiuchi, Koutaro Kyutoku, Yuichiro Sekiguchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: We study the post-merger mass ejection of low-mass binary neutron stars (NSs) with the system mass of 2.5M⊙, and subsequent nucleosynthesis by performing general-relativistic, neutrino-radiation viscous-hydrodynamics simulations in axial symmetry. We find that the merger remnants are long-lived massive NSs surviving more than several seconds, irrespective of the nuclear equations of state (EOSs) adopted.  Post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that the ejecta is composed mainly of light r-process nuclei with small amounts of lanthanides. Such abundance distributions are incompatible with the solar r-process-like abundance patterns found in all measured r-process-enhanced metal-poor stars. Therefore, low-mass binary NS mergers should be rare. If such low-mass NS mergers occur, their electromagnetic counterparts, kilonovae, will be characterized by an early bright blue emission because of the large ejecta mass as well as the small lanthanide fraction. We also show, however, that if the effective turbulent viscosity is very high, or there is an efficient mass ejection working in the early post-merger phase, the electron fraction of the ejecta could be low enough that the solar r-process-like abundance pattern is reproduced and the lanthanide fraction becomes so high that the kilonova would be characterized by early bright blue and late bright red emissions.

authors: Shabnam Iyyani, Vidushi Sharma
topic: The prompt emission of short gamma ray bursts (sGRBs) with known redshifts are analyzed using the model of multi-color blackbody which is interpreted as the emission from a non-dissipative photosphere taking into account the structure and the viewing geometry of the jet. We find nearly 69% and 26% of the sample are consistent with multi-color blackbody and a pure blackbody model, respectively. We find that nearly 57\%(18\%) of the sGRBs in our sample are observed within (or along the edge of) the jet cone. The sGRB jets are found to be very narrow with the most probable value of the jet opening angle, θj=2pm1 deg. This gives the rate of sGRBs that would be viewed within the jet cone to be 0.2−4.4Gpc−3yr−1. The intrinsic luminosity are found to range between 1048−1053erg/s. The average values of Lorentz factor and nozzle radius of the sGRB jets are found to be 210(85) and 107.7(109.6)cm for the cases when the photosphere forms in the coasting (accelerating) phase respectively.

title: Revisiting primordial black holes capture into neutron stars
authors: Yoann Génolini, Pasquale Serpico, Peter Tinyakov
topic: Primordial black holes (PBH), produced through a variety of processes in the early universe, could fill galactic halos accounting for a fraction or the totality of the dark matter. In particular, PBH with sub-stellar masses could be captured by stars, start to swallow their material, and eventually turn them into BH, hence originating a peculiar new type of stellar catastrophic event. Here we revisit this process in the most favorable case of PBH capture by neutron stars. We detail a number of novel features in the capture phase, during the settling within the star and mass growth of the PBH, and illustrate some phenomenological consequences. In particular, we point out that in the subsonic regime the PBH drag takes the form of a Bondi accretion.

title: A systematic study on the rise time-peak luminosity relation for bright optical transients powered by wind shock breakout
authors: Akihiro Suzuki, Takashi J. Moriya, Tomoya Takiwaki
topic: A number of astrophyical transients originating from stellar explosions are powered by the collision of the ejected material with the circumstellar medium, which efficiently produces thermal radiation via shock dissipation. We investigate how such interaction-powered transients are distributed in the peak bolometric luminosity vs the rise time phase space. Taking the advantage of less time-consuming one-dimensional simulations with spherical symmetry, we calculated more than 500 models with different circumstellar mass and radius, ejecta mass and energy, and chemical compositions. The peak bolometric luminosity, the total radiated energy, and the rise time of the interaction-powered emission are measured for each simulated light curve. We consider how these characteristic quantities are determined as a function of the model parameters and discuss possible implications for the observed populations of (potential) interaction-powered transients, such as type IIn supernovae and fast blue optical transients.

authors: Hung Tan, Jacquelyn Noronha-Hostler, Nico Yunes
topic: The observation of gravitational waves from an asymmetric binary opens the possibility for heavy neutron stars, but these pose challenges to models of the neutron star equation of state. We construct heavy neutron stars by introducing non-trivial structure in the speed of sound sourced by deconfined QCD matter, which cannot be well recovered by spectral representations. Their moment of inertia, Love number and quadrupole moment are very small, so a tenfold increase in sensitivity may be needed to test this possibility with gravitational waves, which is feasible with third generation detectors.

topic: We discuss coherent free electron laser (FEL) operating during explosive reconnection events in magnetized pair plasma of magnetar magnetospheres. The model explains many salient features of Fast Radio Bursts/magnetars' radio emission: temporal coincidence of radio and high energy bursts, high efficiency of conversion of plasma kinetic energy into coherent radiation, presence of variable, narrow-band emission features drifting down in frequency, high degree of linear polarization.

title: Photospheric Emission in Gamma-ray Bursts: Variability
authors: Kai Wang, Da-Bin Lin, Yun Wang, Lu-yao Jiang, Shen-Shi Du, Xiao-Yan Li, Jia Ren, Xiang-gao Wang, En-Wei Liang
topic: It is generally believed that the variability of photospheric emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) traces that of the jet power. This work further investigates the variability of photospheric emission in a variable jet. By setting a constant η (dimensionless entropy of the jet), we find that the light curve of the photospheric emission shows a ``tracking'' pattern on the time profile of jet power. However, the relative variability is significantly low in the photospheric emission compared with that in the jet power. If the η is genetic variable, the variability of the photospheric emission is not only limited by the jet power but also affected by η strongly. It becomes complex and is generally different from that of the jet power. Moreover, the opposite phase may stand in the variabilities of the photospheric emission at different photon energies. We also find that the relative variability does not remain constant over the photon energies with an obvious reduction at a certain energy.

title: A rotation-driven pulsar radio emission mechanism]{A rotation-driven pulsar radio emission mechanism
authors: D. B. Melrose, M. Z. Rafat, A. Mastrano
topic: We propose and discuss an alternative pulsar radio emission mechanism that relies on rotation-driven plasma oscillations, rather than on a beam-driven instability, and suggest that it may be the generic radio emission mechanism for pulsars. We identify these oscillations as superluminal longitudinal waves in the pulsar plasma, and point out that these waves can escape directly in the O-mode. Escape of the energy in these oscillations is possible only if they are generated in overdense, field-aligned regions that we call fibers; the wave energy is initially refracted into underdense regions between the fibers, which act as ducts. Some implications of the model for the interpretation of pulsar radio emission are discussed.

We apply the jitter radiation to explain the GRB spectral diversities in the high-energy bands. In our model, the jitter radiative spectral index is determined by the spectral index of the turbulence.

authors: Fan Guo, Yi-Hsin Liu, Xiaocan Li, Hui Li, William Daughton, Patrick Kilian
topic: Magnetic reconnection in strongly magnetized astrophysical plasma environments is believed to be the primary process for fast energy release and particle energization. Currently there is strong interest in relativistic magnetic reconnection, in that it may provide a new explanation for high-energy particle acceleration and radiation in strongly magnetized astrophysical systems. We review recent advances in particle acceleration and reconnection physics in the magnetically-dominated regime. More discussion is focused on the physics of particle acceleration, power-law formation as well as the reconnection rate problem. In addition, we provide an outlook for studying reconnection acceleration mechanisms and kinetic physics in the next step.

title: CMacIonize 2.0: a novel task-based approach to Monte Carlo radiation transfer
authors: Bert Vandenbroucke, Peter Camps
topic: In this work, we present a novel approach to MCRT that addresses the challenging memory access patterns of traditional MCRT algorithms, which hinder optimal performance of MCRT simulations on modern hardware with a complex memory architecture. (Methods) We reformulate the MCRT photon packet life cycle as a task-based algorithm, whereby the computation is broken down into small tasks that are executed concurrently. Photon packets are stored in intermediate buffers, and tasks propagate photon packets through small parts of the computational domain, moving them from one buffer to another in the process. Using the implementation of the new algorithm in the photoionization MCRT code CMacIonize 2.0, we show that the decomposition of the MCRT grid into small parts leads to a significant performance gain during the photon packet propagation phase, which constitutes the bulk of an MCRT algorithm, as a result of better usage of memory caches.

title: On dynamics of nonmagnetic accretion disks
authors: V. S. Borisov
topic: Axisymmetric accretion disks in vicinity of a central compact body are studied. In the case of non-viscous disk it is proven that all solutions for the midplane circular velocity are unstable. Hence, the pure hydrodynamic turbulence in accretion disks is possible. It is disproved the well-known arguments that an inviscid accretion disk must be sub-Keplerian. It is also demonstrated that the regular asymptotic solutions, often used in astrophysics, can lead to erroneous conclusions. It is proven that a laminar viscous disk can be approximated with a great precision by the vortex motion. Assuming that a turbulent gas tends to flow with minimal losses, we have shown that a turbulent disk tends to be Keplerian.

authors: T. R. Routray, S. P. Pattnaik, C. Gonzalez-Boquera, X. Viñas, M. Centelles, B. Behera
topic: We perform a systematic study of the dependence of the r-mode phenomenology in normal fluid pulsar neutron stars on the symmetry energy slope parameter L. An essential ingredient in this study is the bulk viscosity, which is evaluated consistently for several equations of state corresponding to different values of the slope parameter L. Direct Urca processes, which are allowed from a critical L-value onwards, enhance the bulk viscosity and have large influence on the r-mode features, such as the instability boundary and spin-down properties of newborn neutron stars. The magnitude of the changes in the r-mode properties induced by the direct Urca processes are driven by the L-value of the equation of state and the mass of the pulsar.

topic: Ages and thermal luminosities of neutron stars, inferred from observations, can be interpreted with the aid of the neutron star cooling theory to gain information on the properties of superdense matter in neutron-star interiors. We present a survey of estimated ages, surface temperatures and thermal luminosities of middle-aged neutron stars with relatively weak or moderately strong magnetic fields, which can be useful for these purposes. The catalogue includes results selected from the literature, supplemented with new results of spectral analysis of a few cooling neutron stars. The data are compared with the theory. We show that overall agreement of theoretical cooling curves with observations improves substantially for models where neutron superfluidity in stellar core is weak.

title: Kink-driven magnetic reconnection in relativistic jets: consequences for X-ray polarimetry of BL Lacs
authors: Gianluigi Bodo, Fabrizo Tavecchio, Lorenzo Sironi
topic: We investigate with relativistic MHD simulations the dissipation physics of BL Lac jets, by studying the synchrotron polarization signatures of particles accelerated by the kink instability in a magnetically-dominated plasma column. The nonlinear stage of the kink instability generates current sheets, where particles can be efficiently accelerated via magnetic reconnection. We identify current sheets as regions where s = J d/B is above some predefined threshold (where B is the field strength, J the current density and d the grid scale), and assume that the particle injection efficiency scales as proportional to the square of the current. X-ray emitting particles have short cooling times, so they only probe the field geometry of their injection sites. In contrast, particles emitting in the optical band, which we follow self-consistently as they propagate away from their injection sites while cooling, sample a larger volume, and so they may be expected to produce different polarimetric signatures.

title: Parameter estimation for strong phase transitions in supranuclear matter using gravitational-wave astronomy
authors: Peter T. H. Pang, Tim Dietrich, Ingo Tews, Chris Van Den Broeck
topic: At supranuclear densities, explored in the core of neutron stars, a strong phase transition from hadronic matter to more exotic forms of matter might be present. To test this hypothesis, binary neutron-star mergers offer a unique possibility to probe matter at densities that we can not create in any existing terrestrial experiment. In this work, we show that, if present, strong phase transitions can have a measurable imprint on the binary neutron-star coalescence and the emitted gravitational-wave signal. We construct a new parameterization of the supranuclear equation of state that allows us to test for the existence of a strong phase transition and extract its characteristic properties purely from the gravitational-wave signal of the inspiraling neutron stars.

topic: While the primary was most likely a black hole, the secondary could be interpreted as either the lightest black hole or the most massive neutron star ever observed, but also as the indication of a novel class of exotic compact objects. We here argue that the secondary in GW190814 needs not be an ab-initio black hole nor an exotic object; rather, based on our current understanding of the nuclear-matter equation of state, it can be a rapidly rotating neutron star that collapsed to a rotating black hole at some point before merger.

Since it has been demonstrated that the stacking searches for astrophysical GRB neutrinos strongly constrain the parameter space in single-zone models, we focus on the dynamics of multiple collisions for which different messengers are expected to come from different regions of the same object. We propose a model which can describe both stochastic and deterministic engines, which we study in a systematic way.

title: Monte-Carlo simulations of fast Newtonian and mildly relativistic shock breakout from a stellar wind
authors: Hirotaka Ito, Amir Levinson, Ehud Nakar
topic: Strong explosion of a compact star surrounded by a thick stellar wind drives a fast (greater 0.1c) radiation mediated shock (RMS) that propagates in the wind, and ultimately breaks out gradually once photons start escaping from the shock transition layer. In exceptionally strong or aspherical explosions the shock velocity may even be relativistic. The properties of the breakout signal depend on the dynamics and structure of the shock during the breakout phase. Here we present, for the first time, spectra and lightcurves of the breakout emission of fast Newtonian and mildly relativistic shocks, that were calculated using self-consistent Monte-Carlo simulations of finite RMS with radiative losses.

title: Nuclear Reaction Screening, Weak Interactions, and r-Process Nucleosynthesis in High Magnetic Fields
authors: Michael Famiano, A. Baha Balantekin, Toshitaka Kajino, Motohiko Kusakabe, Kanji Mori, Yudong Luo
topic: Coulomb screening and weak interactions in a hot, magnetized plasma are investigated. Coulomb screening is evaluated in a relativistic thermal plasma in which electrons and positrons are in equilibrium. In addition to temperature effects, effects on weak screening from a strong external magnetic field are evaluated. In high fields, the electron transverse momentum components are quantized into Landau levels. The characteristic plasma screening length at high temperatures and at high magnetic fields is explored. In addition to changes to the screening length, changes in weak interaction rates are estimated. It is found that high fields can result in increased β-decay rates as the electron and positron spectra are dominated by Landau levels. Finally, the effects studied here are evaluated in a simple r-process model. It is found that relativistic Coulomb screening has a small effect on the final abundance distribution. While changes in weak interaction rates in strong magnetic fields can have an effect on the r-process evolution and abundance distribution, the field strength required to have a significant effect may be larger than what is currently thought to be typical of the r-process environment in collapsar jets or neutron star mergers.

topic: We report the first plausible optical electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to a (candidate) binary black hole (BBH) merger. Detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), the EM flare is consistent with expectations for a kicked BBH merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), and is unlikely due to intrinsic variability of this source. The lack of color evolution implies that it is not a supernovae and instead is strongly suggestive of a constant temperature shock. Other false-positive events, such as microlensing or a tidal disruption event, are ruled out or constrained.

topic: We report the discovery and panchromatic followup observations of the young Type Ic supernova, SN2020oi, in M100, a grand design spiral galaxy at a mere distance of 14 Mpc. We followed up with observations at radio, X-ray and optical wavelengths from only a few days to several months after explosion. The optical behaviour of the supernova is similar to those of other normal Type Ic supernovae. Given, the relatively small number of stripped envelope SNe for which radio emission is detectable, we used this opportunity to perform a detailed analysis of the comprehensive radio dataset we obtained. The radio emitting electrons initially experience a phase of inverse Compton cooling which leads to steepening of the spectral index of the radio emission.

topic: Cosmic strings and first-order phase transition are two main sources for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we study the stochastic gravitational wave radiation from cosmic string which is formed after the first-order phase transition. For the first-order phase transition occurs at temperature far beyond the electroweak scale, the gravitational wave signal cannot be reached by the future gravitational wave interferometers. The gravitational waves from cosmic strings that formed after the phase transition can be detected by future gravitational wave detectors in a wide range of frequency, and therefore its imprints can serve to search for firs-order phase transitions at high scales with the phase transition temperature:

title: Two-fluid simulations of the magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores in the weak-coupling regime
authors: F. Castillo, A. Reisenegger, J. A. Valdivia
topic: In a previous paper, we reported simulations of the evolution of the magnetic field in neutron star cores through ambipolar diffusion, taking the neutrons as a motionless uniform background. However, in real neutron stars, neutrons are free to move, and a strong composition gradient leads to stable stratification (stability against convective motions) both of which might impact on the time-scales of evolution. Here we address these issues by providing the first long-term two-fluid simulations of the evolution of an axially symmetric magnetic field in a neutron star core composed of neutrons, protons, and electrons with density and composition gradients. However, the evolution is found to be faster than in the case of motionless neutrons, as the movement of charged particles (which are coupled to the magnetic field, but are also limited by the collisional drag forces exerted by neutrons) is less constrained, since neutrons are now allowed to move. The possible impact of non-axisymmetric instabilities on these equilibria, as well as beta decays, proton superconductivity, and neutron superfluidity, are left for future work.

authors: Axel Brandenburg
topic: The ohmic decay of magnetic fields in the crusts of neutron stars is generally believed to be governed by Hall drift which leads to what is known as a Hall cascade. Here we show that helical and fractionally helical magnetic fields undergo strong inverse cascading like in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but the magnetic energy decays much more slowly Even for a nonhelical magnetic field there is inverse cascading with an increase of magnetic energy at the largest possible scale in the system. The strength of this effect depends on the strength of the magnetic field and disappears for weak fields.

topic: We report the observation of a compact binary coalescence involving a 22.2 - 24.3 Msun black hole and a compact object with a mass of 2.50 - 2.67 Msun (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run on August 14, 2019 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg2 at a distance of 241+41−45 Mpc; no electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves, 0.112+0.008−0.009, and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to less or eqyal 0.07. Tests of general relativity reveal no measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at high confidence.

topic: In the modern era of abundant X-ray detections and the increasing momentum of gravitational waves astronomy, tests of General Relativity in strong field regime become increasingly feasible and their importance for probing gravity cannot be understated. To this end, we study the characteristics of slowly rotating topological neutron stars in the tensor-multi-scalar theories of gravity following the static study of this new type of compact objects by two of the authors. We explore the moment of inertia and verify that universal relations known from General Relativity hold for this new class of compact objects. Furthermore, we study the properties of their innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and the epicyclic frequencies due to the latter's hinted link to observational quantities such as quasi-periodic X-ray spectrum features.

title: A Generalized Kompaneets Formalism for Inelastic Neutrino-Nucleon Scattering in Supernova Simulations
authors: Tianshu Wang, Adam Burrows
topic: Based on the Kompaneets approximation, we develop a robust methodology to calculate spectral redistribution via inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering in the context of core-collapse supernova simulations. The resulting equations conserve lepton number to machine precision and scale linearly, not quadratically, with number of energy groups. The formalism also provides an elegant means to derive the rate of energy transfer to matter which, as it must, automatically goes to zero when the neutrino radiation field is in thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we derive the next-higher-order in {\epsilon}/mc2 correction to the neutrino Kompaneets equation. Unlike other Kompaneets schema, ours also generalizes to the case of anisotropic angular distributions, while retaining the conservative form that is a hallmark of the classical Kompaneets equation. Our formalism enables immediate incorporation into supernova codes that follow the spectral angular moments of the neutrino radiation fields.

title: Testing the Weak Equivalence Principle and Lorentz Invariance with Multiwavelength Polarization Observations of GRB Optical Afterglows
authors: Jun-Jie Wei, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: Violations of both the weak equivalence principle (WEP) and Lorentz invariance can produce vacuum birefringence, which leads to an energy-dependent rotation of the polarization vector of linearly polarized emission from a given astrophysical source. However, the search for the birefringent effect has been hindered by our ignorance concerning the intrinsic polarization angle in different energy bands. Considering the contributions to the observed linear polarization angle from both the intrinsic polarization angle and the rotation angles induced by violations of the WEP and Lorentz invariance, and assuming the intrinsic polarization angle is an unknown constant, we simultaneously obtain robust bounds on possible deviations from the WEP and Lorentz invariance, by directly fitting the multiwavelength polarimetric data of the optical afterglows of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 020813 and GRB 021004.

topic: The wind driven by the intense neutrino emission from a protoneutron star (PNS) is an important site for producing nuclei heavier than the Fe group. Because of certain features in the neutrino angular distributions, the so-called fast flavor oscillations may occur very close to the PNS surface, effectively resetting the neutrino luminosities and energy spectra that drive the wind.
Using the unoscillated neutrino emission characteristics from two core-collapse supernova simulations representative of relevant progenitors at the lower and higher mass end, we study the potential effects of fast flavor oscillations on neutrino-driven winds and their nucleosynthesis.

title: Higher-order gravitational-wave modes will allow for percent-level measurements of Hubble's constant with single binary neutron star merger observations
authors: Juan Calderón Bustillo, Tim Dietrich, Paul D. Lasky
topic: The first multi-messenger gravitational-wave observation of a binary neutron star merger allowed for the first distance-ladder independent measure of Hubble's constant, albeit with an uncertainty of ∼15% at the 68\% credible level. We show that a single future observation of a binary neutron star merger with a network of detectors sensitive to the post-merger remnant at a few kHz, and commensurate improvement in cosmological redshift measurements, will allow for percent-level uncertainties in measurement of Hubble's constant. We show how higher-order modes can be exploited in astrophysical parameter estimation in both the inspiral phase, and also the post-merger remnant. While former suffices in the case of unequal-mass binaries to obtain major improvements in the distance estimates, the latter is crucial for equal-mass cases.

We demonstrate the influence of the fission fragment distributions for neutron-rich nuclei and discuss currently available treatments, including recent macroscopic-microscopic calculations. We conclude by comparing our nucleosynthesis results directly with stellar data for metal-poor stars rich in r-process elements to consider whether fission plays a role in the so-called `universality' of r-process abundances observed from star to star.

title: A brief overview of black hole-neutron star mergers
authors: Francois Foucart
topic: Of the three main types of binaries detectable through ground-based gravitational wave observations, black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers remain the most elusive. While candidates BHNS exist in the triggers released during the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO/Virgo collaboration, no detection has been confirmed so far. As for binary neutron star systems, BHNS binaries allow us to explore a wide range of physical processes, including the neutron star equation of state, nucleosynthesis, stellar evolution, high-energy astrophysics, and the expansion of the Universe. Here, we review some of the main features of BHNS systems: the distinction between disrupting and non-disrupting binaries, the types of outflows that BHNS mergers can produce, and the information that can be extracted from the observation of their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals. We also emphasize that for the most likely binary parameters, BHNS mergers seem less likely to power electromagnetic signals than binary neutron star systems. Finally, we discuss some of the issues that still limit our ability to model and interpret electromagnetic signals from BHNS binaries.

authors: N. Fraija, T. Laskar, S. Dichiara, P. Beniamini, R. Barniol Duran, M.G. Dainotti, R. L. Becerra
topic: The Fermi-LAT collaboration presented the second gamma-ray burst (GRB) catalog covering its first 10 years of operations. A significant fraction of afterglow-phase light curves in this catalog cannot be explained by the closure relations of the standard synchrotron forward-shock model, suggesting that there could be an important contribution from another process. In view of the above, we derive the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) light curves from the reverse shock in the thick- and thin-shell regime for a uniform-density medium. We show that this emission could explain the GeV flares exhibited in some LAT light curves. Additionally, we demonstrate that the passage of the forward shock synchrotron cooling break through the LAT band from jets expanding in a uniform-density environment may be responsible for the late time

title: Constraining Magnetic Fields in the Circumgalactic Medium
authors: Ting-Wen Lan, J. Xavier Prochaska
topic: We study the properties of magnetic fields in the circumgalactic medium galaxies by correlating Faraday rotation measures of ∼1,000 high-redshift radio sources with the foreground galaxy number density estimated from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This method enables us to extract signals of rotation measures contributed by intervening gas around multiple galaxies. Our results show that there is no detectable correlation between the distribution of rotation measures and the number of foreground galaxies, contrary to several previous results. By adopting a column density distribution of ionized gas obtained from absorption line measurements, we further estimate the strengths of coherent magnetic fields parallel to the line of sight of less the equal 2 micro Gauss in the CGM.

title: General Relativistic Mean-field Dynamo Model for Proto-neutron Stars
authors: K. Franceschetti, L. Del Zanna
topic: Neutron stars, and magnetars in particular, are known to host the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. The origin of these strong fields is a matter of controversy. In this preliminary work, via numerical simulations, we study, for the first time in non-ideal general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) regime, the growth of the magnetic field due to the action of the mean-field dynamo due to sub-scale, unresolved turbulence. The dynamo process, combined with the differential rotation of the (proto-)star, is able to produce an exponential growth of any initial magnetic seed field up to the values required to explain the observations. By varying the dynamo coefficient we obtain different growth rates. We find a quasi-linear dependence of the growth rates on the intensity of the dynamo. Furthermore, the time interval in which exponential growth occurs and the growth rates also seems to depend on the initial configuration of the magnetic field.

title: Deciphering the properties of the central engine in GRB collapsars
authors: M. Petropoulou, P. Beniamini, G. Vasilopoulos, D. Giannios, R. Barniol Duran
topic: The central engine in long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is thought to be a compact object produced by the core collapse of massive stars, but its exact nature (black hole or millisecond magnetar) is still debatable. Although the central engine of GRB collapsars is hidden to direct observation, its properties may be imprinted on the accompanying electromagnetic signals. We aim to decipher the generic properties of central engines that are consistent with prompt observations of long GRBs detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Adopting a generic model for the central engine, in which the engine power and activity timescale are independent of each other, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of long GRBs produced by jets that successfully breakout from the star. The intrinsic 2D distribution of simulated collapsar GRBs peaks at lower gamma-ray luminosities and longer durations than the observed one, a prediction that can be tested in the future with more sensitive detectors. Black-hole accretors, whose power and activity time are set by the large-scale magnetic flux through the progenitor star and stellar structure, respectively, are compatible with the properties of the central engine inferred by our model.

title: Accretion-to-jet energy conversion efficiency in GW170817
authors: Om S. Salafia, Bruno Giacomazzo
topic: Based on previously published multi-wavelength modelling of the GRB 170817A jet afterglow, that includes information from the VLBI centroid motion, we construct the posterior probability density distribution on the total energy in the bipolar jets launched by the GW170817 merger remnant. By applying a new numerical-relativity-informed fitting formula for the accretion disk mass, we construct the posterior probability density distribution of the GW170817 remnant disk mass. By combining the two, we estimate the accretion-to-jet energy conversion efficiency in this system, carefully accounting for uncertainties.  Such an efficiency also agrees with that anticipated for the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, provided that the magnetic field in the disk right after the merger is predominantly toroidal (which is expected as a result of the merger dynamics).

title: Bulk Viscous Damping of Density Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Mark Alford, Arus Harutyunyan, Armen Sedrakian
topic: We discuss the damping of density oscillations in dense nuclear matter in the temperature range relevant to neutron star mergers. This damping is due to bulk viscosity arising from the weak interaction ``Urca'' processes of neutron decay and electron capture. The nuclear matter is modelled in the relativistic density functional approach. The bulk viscosity reaches a resonant maximum close to the neutrino trapping temperature, then drops rapidly as temperature rises into the range where neutrinos are trapped in neutron stars. We investigate the bulk viscous dissipation timescales in a post-merger object and identify regimes where these timescales are as short as the characteristic timescale 10 ms, and, therefore, might affect the evolution of the post-merger object. Our analysis indicates that bulk viscous damping would be important at not too high temperatures of the order of a few MeV and densities up to a few times saturation density.

authors: V. A. Acciari, S. Ansoldi, L. A. Antonelli, A. Arbet Engels, D. Baack, A. Babić, B. Banerjee, U. Barres de Almeida, J. A. Barrio et al
topic: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from ultra-relativistic jets launched from the collapsing cores of dying massive stars. They are characterised by an initial phase of bright and highly variable radiation in the keV-MeV band that is likely produced within the jet and lasts from milliseconds to minutes, known as the prompt emission. Subsequently, the interaction of the jet with the external medium generates external shock waves, responsible for the afterglow emission, which lasts from days to months, and occurs over a broad energy range, from the radio to the GeV bands. The afterglow emission is generally well explained as synchrotron radiation by electrons accelerated at the external shock. We find that the broadband spectral energy distribution is double-peaked, with the TeV emission constituting a distinct spectral component that has power comparable to the synchrotron component.

authors: MAGIC Collaboration: V. A. Acciari, S. Ansoldi, L. A. Antonelli, A. Arbet Engels, D. Baack, A. Babić, B. Banerjee, U. Barres de Almeida et al
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) of the long-duration class are the most luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation known in the Universe. They are generated by outflows of plasma ejected at near the speed of light by newly formed neutron stars or black holes of stellar mass at cosmological distances. Prompt flashes of MeV gamma rays are followed by longer-lasting afterglow emission from radio waves to GeV gamma rays, due to synchrotron radiation by energetic electrons in accompanying shock waves. Although emission of gamma rays at even higher, TeV energies by other radiation mechanisms had been theoretically predicted, it had never been detected previously. Here we report the clear detection of GRB 190114C in the TeV band, achieved after many years of dedicated searches for TeV emission from GRBs The observed similarity in the radiated power and temporal behaviour of the TeV and X-ray bands points to processes such as inverse Compton radiation as the mechanism of the TeV emission, while processes such as synchrotron emission by ultrahigh-energy protons are disfavoured due to their low radiative efficiency.

title: Radio Emission from Ultra-stripped Supernovae as Diagnostics for Properties of the Remnant Double Neutron Star Binaries
authors: Tomoki Matsuoka, Keiichi Maeda
topic: An ultra-stripped supernova (SN) is an explosion of a helium or C+O star whose outer envelope has been stripped away by a companion neutron star. A double neutron star (DNS) binary is believed to be left after the explosion, which will emit the gravitational wave later at the coalescence. Recent detections of a few candidates for the ultra-stripped SN have constrained the properties of the explosion and the progenitor, but little information is given as to whether the remnant DNS binary will merge within the cosmic age. A large fraction of the material stripped away from the helium star through the binary interaction is expected to escape from the system and form circumstellar material (CSM). The CSM should be traced by radio emission induced by the collision with the SN ejecta. Based on the stellar evolution models previously developed, we calculate the expected radio luminosities from ultra-stripped SNe. We find that high radio luminosity at its maximum can be an indicator of small separation of a DNS binary leading to its merger within the cosmic age. Our results can be used to optimize the strategy for the radio follow-up observations such as observational epochs and frequencies.

title: Neutron star inner crust: effects of rotation and magnetic fields
authors: Ivo Sengo, Helena Pais, Bruno Franzon, Constança Providência
topic: We study the role of the pasta phases on the properties of rotating and magnetized neutron stars. In order to investigate such systems, we make use of two different relativistic mean-field unified inner-crust--core equations of state, with a different density dependence of the symmetry energy, and an inner-crust computed within a Thomas-Fermi calculation. Special attention is given to the crust-core transition density, and the pasta phases effects on the global properties of stars. The effects of strong magnetic fields and fast rotation are computed by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations self-consistently, taking into account anisotropies induced by the centrifugal and the Lorentz force. The location of the magnetic field neutral line and the maximum of the Lorentz force on the equatorial plane are calculated. The conditions under which they fall inside the inner crust region are discussed. We verified that models with a larger symmetry energy slope show more sensitivity to the variation of the magnetic field.

authors: A. K. H. Kong, K. L. Li, S. Kim, C. Y. Hui
topic: The recent discovery of a millisecond radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has initiated an intense discussion about the connection between magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Although some properties of the radio burst from SGR 1935+2154 are not the same as cosmological FRBs, there are theoretical models which propose a connection between magnetars and FRBs (see review by Margalit et al. 2020). In particular, the role of a magnetar wind nebula is included in some models, and therefore it is worthwhile to investigate the X-ray environment of SGR 1935+2154 in more detail. Here, we report on the discovery of an X-ray transient feature near SGR 1935+2154 using archival Chandra data and discuss its possible origin.

title: Reverse Shocks in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts -- The case of GRB 160821B and prospects as gravitational-wave counterparts
authors: Gavin P Lamb
topic: The shock system that produces the afterglow to GRBs consists of a forward- and a reverse-shock. For short GRBs, observational evidence for a reverse-shock has been sparse, however, the afterglow to GRB 160821B requires a reverse-shock at early times to explain the radio observations. GRB 160821B is additionally accompanied by the best-sampled macronova without a gravitational-wave detection, and an interesting late-time X-ray afterglow behaviour indicative of a refreshed-shock. The presence of an observed reverse-shock in an on-axis short GRB means that the reverse-shock should be considered as a potential counterpart to gravitational-wave detected mergers. As a gravitational-wave counterpart, the afterglow to an off-axis GRB jet can reveal the jet structure -- a reverse-shock will exist in these structured jet systems and the signature of these reverse-shocks, if observed, can indicate the degree of magnetisation in the outflow. Here we show the case of GRB 160821B, and how a reverse-shock will appear for an off-axis observer to a structured jet.

topic: Meteoritic analysis demonstrates that radioactive nuclei heavier than iron were present in the early Solar System. Among them, 129I and 247Cm both have a rapid neutron-capture process (r process) origin and decay on the same timescale (approx 15.6 Myr). We show that the 129I/247Cm abundance ratio in the early Solar System (433 plus minus 184) is immune to galactic evolution uncertainties and represents the first direct observational constraint for the properties of the last r-process event that polluted the pre-solar nebula. We investigate the physical conditions of this event using nucleosynthesis calculations and demonstrate that moderately neutron-rich ejecta can produce the observed ratio. We conclude that a dominant contribution by exceedingly neutron-rich ejecta is highly disfavoured.

The current dataset appears consistent both with energy injection by a long-lived central engine and with the onset of a kilonova afterglow, arising from the interaction of the sub-relativistic merger ejecta with the surrounding medium. Long-term monitoring of this source will be essential to test these different models.

title: The jet structure and the intrinsic luminosity function of short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Wei-Wei Tan, Yun-Wei Yu
topic: The joint observation of GW170817 and GRB 170817A indicated that short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) can originate from binary neutron star mergers. Moreover, some SGRBs could be detected off-axis, while the SGRB jets are highly structured. Then, by assuming an universal angular distribution of the jet emission for all SGRBs For self-consistency, this angular distribution is simultaneously constrained by the luminosity and event rate of GRB 170817A. Meanwhile, the intrinsic luminosity function (LF) of the on-axis emission of the jets can be simply described by a single power law with a low-luminosity exponential cutoff. The usually discovered broken-power-law apparent LF for relatively high luminosities can naturally result from the coupling of the intrinsic LF with the angular distribution of the jet emission, as the viewing angles to the SGRBs are arbitrarily distributed.

By compiling all archival data, and reprocessing a subset of it, we have ensured that the panchromatic dataset is uniform and therefore immune to the differences in data processing or flux determination methods used by different groups. Our fits to the afterglow data using an analytical model that includes VLBI proper motion from Mooley et al (2018), and a structured jet model that ignores the proper motion, indicates that the proper motion measurement needs to be considered while seeking an accurate estimate of the viewing angle.

title: The structure of hydrodynamic γ-ray burst jets
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Ehud Nakar, Omer Bromberg
topic: Here, using a set of 3D simulations we follow the evolution of hydrodynamic long and short GRB jets after breakout and provide a physically motivated post-breakout outflow structure of GRB jets (the structure of weakly magnetized jets is underway). Our simulations feature Rayleigh-Taylor fingers, which grow from the cocoon into the jet and destabilize it. The mixing of jet-cocoon material gives rise to a previously unidentified region between the two, which we denote the jet-cocoon interface (JCI). In lGRBs the mixing is strong, leading to most of the outflow energy to drift into the JCI. In sGRBs, where the medium is lighter, the mixing is weaker, and the JCI and the jet core hold a comparable amount of energy. At larger angles, where the cocoon dominates, the structure is more complex including both an angular and a radial structure. The mixing shapes the prompt light curve and implies that typical afterglows of lGRBs are different from those of sGRBs. The predictions that we provide can be used to infer jet characteristics from prompt and afterglow observations.

title: The Luminosity Distribution of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts under a Structured Jet Scenario
authors: Qi Guo, Daming Wei, Yuanzhu Wang
topic:  In this paper, we calculate the luminosity distribution of sGRBs and its evolution with redshift based on the structured (Gaussian) jet model, and find that the typical luminosity increase with redshift, for nearby sGRBs (such as for luminosity distance less than 200 Mpc) the typical gamma-ray luminosity is just around  which naturally explains the very low radiation luminosity of GRB 170817A. We derived the detection probability of sGRBs by Fermi-GBM and found that the expected detection rate of sGRBs is only about 1 yr-1 within the distance of several hundred Mpc. Finally, we compare our results of gamma-ray luminosity distribution with sGRBs with known redshifts, and found that our results are consistent with the observation, which implies that our simulation results can reproduce the observed luminosity distribution well.

title: Variability in Short Gamma-ray Bursts: Gravitationally Unstable Tidal Tails
authors: Eric R. Coughlin, C. J. Nixon, Jennifer Barnes, Brian D. Metzger, R. Margutti
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts are thought to result from the mergers of two neutron stars or a neutron star and stellar mass black hole. The final stages of the merger are generally accompanied by the production of one or more tidal "tails" of ejecta, which fall back onto the remnant-disc system at late times. Using the results of a linear stability analysis, we show that if the material comprising these tails is modeled as adiabatic and the effective adiabatic index satisfies γ≥5/3, then the tails are gravitationally unstable and collapse to form small-scale knots. We analytically estimate the properties of these knots, including their spacing along the tidal tail and the total number produced, and their effect on the mass return rate to the merger remnant. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of the disruption of a polytropic (with the polytropic and adiabatic indices γ equal), γ=2 neutron star by a black hole, and find agreement between the predictions of the linear stability analysis and the distribution of knots that collapse out of the instability.

title: Pair separation in parallel electric field of a magnetar magnetosphere and narrow spectra of fast radio bursts
authors: Yuan-Pei Yang, Jin-Ping Zhu, Bing Zhang, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: When a magnetar magnetosphere is trigged by crustal deformations, an electric field E|| parallel to the magnetic field line would appear via Alvfén waves in the charge starvation region. If electron-positron pair bunches pre-exist, e.g., via some possible plasma instabilities, in the magnetosphere, these pairs will undergo charge separation in the E|| and in the meantime emit coherent curvature radiation. Following the approach of Yang & Zhang (2018), we find that the superposed curvature radiation becomes narrower due to charge separation, with the width of spectrum depending on the separation between the electron and positron clumps. This mechanism can interpret the narrow spectra of FRBs, in particular, the Galactic FRB 200428 recently detected in association with a hard X-ray burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154.

title: Analytical Solutions of Radiative Transfer Equations in Accretion Discs with Finite Optical Depth
authors: Maryam Samadi, Fahimeh Habibi, Shahram Abbassi
topic: The main purpose of this paper is to obtain analytical solutions for radiative transfer equations related to the vertical structure of accretion discs with finite optical depth. In the non-gray atmosphere, we employ the optical-depth dependent Eddington factor to define the relationship between the mean intensity and radiation stress tensor. Analytical solutions are achieved for two cases: (i) radiative equilibrium, and (ii) a disc with uniform internal heating and both cases are assumed to be in local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE), too. Our results show that for the first case, the surface value of mean intensity with constant Eddington factor is three times larger than that with a variable factor. Moreover, scattering has no role in the vertical radiative structure of discs with the assumptions of the first case. On the other hand, for the second case, we encounter reductions in all radiative quantities as the photon destruction probability decreases (which is equivalent to increasing scattering).

As pulsars cool down, the equilibrium between both spacetime is altered, thereby triggering the well-observed glitch phenomena.

topic: Detection and parameter estimation of binary neutron star merger remnants can shed light on the physics of hot matter at supranuclear densities. Here we develop a fast, simple model that can generate gravitational waveforms, and show it can be used for both detection and parameter estimation of post-merger remnants. The model consists of three exponentially-damped sinusoids with a linear frequency-drift term. The median fitting factors between the model waveforms and numerical-relativity simulations exceed 0.90. We detect remnants at a post-merger signal-to-noise ratio of \geq 7 using a Bayes-factor detection statistic with a threshold of 3000.

topic: Context: Eruptive events such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares accelerate particles and generate shock waves which can arrive at Earth and can disturb the magnetosphere. Understanding the association between CMEs and CME-driven shocks is therefore highly important for space weather studies. Aims: We present a study of the CME/flare event associated with two type II bursts observed on September 27, 2012. The aim of the study is to understand the relationship between the observed CME and the two distinct shock wave signatures. Methods: The multi-wavelength study of the eruptive event (CME/flare) was complemented with radio triangulation of the associated radio emission and modelling of the CME and the shock wave employing MHD simulations. Results: We found that, although temporal association between the type II bursts and the CME is good, the low-frequency type II(LF-type II) burst occurs significantly higher in the corona than the CME and its relationship to the CME is not straightforward.

The extent to which spallation modifies the final NSM isotopic yields depends on: the ejected abundances, which are determined by the NSM astrophysical conditions and the properties of nuclei far from stability, the ejecta velocity distribution and propagation in interstellar matter, and the spallation cross-sections. Observed solar and stellar r-process yields could thus constrain the velocity distribution of ejected neutron star matter, assuming NSMs are the dominant r-process source

title: Towards a paradigm change in the main heavy r-process nucleosynthesis sites
authors: Aldana Grichener, Noam Soker 
topic: We study the basic properties of three possible r-process scenarios (sites) and compare them to recent observations and theoretical simulations. We find that the common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can account for the different observations of r-process nucleosynthesis, including the presence of r-process-rich low-metalicity stars in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The neutron star (NS)-NS merger scenario and the collapsar scenario encounter some difficulties. Despite that, we conclude that it is very likely that more than one r-process scenario exists, with a significant contribution by the CEJSN r-process scenario. We give a prescription to include this scenario in population synthesis studies of the r-process.

We develop a phase-agnostic likelihood model that uses only the spectral content for parameter estimation and demonstrate the calculation of a Bayesian upper limit in the absence of a signal.

authors: Tim Dietrich, Katy Clough
topic: we perform numerical relativity simulations of a binary neutron star merger, including a phenomenological description of the nucleon-nucleon-axion bremsstrahlung to quantify the effects of such a cooling channel on the dynamical evolution. While our simulations show a difference in the temperature profile of the merger remnant, the imprint of the axion via nucleon-nucleon-axion bremsstrahlung on the emitted gravitational wave signal and the ejecta mass is too small to improve constraints on the axion mass with current or future planned detectors. Whilst we consider a limited number of cases, and a simplified cooling model, these broadly represent the "best case" scenario, thus, a more thorough investigation is unlikely to change the conclusions, at least for this particular interaction channel.

title: Using failed supernovae to constrain the Galactic r-process element production
authors: B. Wehmeyer, C. Frohlich, B. Côté, M. Pignatari, F.-K. Thielemann
topic: The large scatter of r-process elements in the early Galaxy suggests that the r-process is made by rare events, like compact binary mergers and rare sub-classes of supernovae. Although being rare, neutron star mergers alone have difficulties to explain the observed enhancement of r-process elements in the lowest metallicity stars compared to Fe. In this work we investigate another complementary scenario, where the r-process occurs in neutron star-black hole mergers in addition to neutron star mergers. Neutron star-black hole mergers would eject similar amounts of r-process matter as neutron star mergers, but only the neutron star progenitor would have produced Fe.

The combination of dilution and small number statistics produces a large scatter in the expected r-process enrichment within a single UFD or classical dwarf galaxy. Comparison between our results and observed europium abundances reveals a tension that even a systematic choice of optimistic parameters in our models cannot release. Such a discrepancy could point to the need of additional r-process production sites that suffer less severe dilution or to a population of extremely fast merging binaries.

The resulting absorption drives up the electron fraction in a structured, continuous outflow, with electron fraction as high as Ye∼0.4 in the extreme polar region. We show via nuclear reaction network and radiative transfer calculations that nucleosynthesis in the disk wind will produce a blue kilonova.

We then expand this analysis to determine the properties of magnetar merger remnants that may be formed via a general population of binary neutron star mergers. Our results demonstrate that many of the potential coherent emission mechanisms that have been proposed for such events can be detected or very tightly constrained by the complementary strategies used by the current generation of low-frequency radio telescopes

title: The lanthanide fraction distribution in metal-poor stars: a test of neutron star mergers as the dominant r-process site
authors: Alexander P. Ji, Maria R. Drout, Terese T. Hansen
topic: The lanthanide fraction (XLa) is a measurable quantity in both kilonovae and metal-poor stars, but it has not previously been explicitly calculated for stars. Here, we compute the lanthanide fraction distribution of metal-poor stars to enable comparison to current and future kilonovae. For neutron star mergers to remain viable as the dominant r-process site, future kilonova observations should be preferentially lanthanide-rich. These high-XLa kilonovae may be fainter and more rapidly evolving than GW170817, posing a challenge for discovery and follow-up observations

This allows us to (i) study the emerging structure and amplification of the magnetic field and observe a clear saturation at magnetic energy 10^51. We follow the magnetically supported expansion of the outer layers of the remnant NS and its evolution into an ellipsoidal shape without any surrounding torus. We also argue that the conditions at the end of the simulation disfavor later jet formation on subsecond timescales if no BH is formed.

authors: Gor Oganesyan, Stefano Ascenzi, Marica Branchesi, Om Sharan Salafia, Simone Dall'Osso, Giancarlo Ghirlanda
topic: Here we show that the high-latitude emission from a structured jet can naturally produce an X-ray plateau in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves, independent of the radiation from an external shock. We calculate the radiation from a switched-off shell featuring an angular structure in both its relativistic bulk motion and intrinsic brightness. Our model is able to explain the shallow decay phase (plateau) often observed in GRB X-ray light curves. We discuss the possible contribution of the structured jet high-latitude emission to other distinctive features of GRB X-ray light curves, and its capability to explain the chromatic optical/X-ray light curve properties.

topic: Here we investigate the use of fine-structure, line-binned opacities that preserve the integral of the opacity over frequency. Advantages of this area-preserving approach over the traditional expansion-opacity formalism include the ability to pre-calculate opacity tables that are independent of the type of hydrodynamic expansion and that eliminate the computational expense of calculating opacities within radiation-transport simulations. Tabular opacities are generated for all 14 lanthanides as well as a representative actinide element, uranium. We demonstrate that spectral simulations produced with the line-binned opacities agree well with results produced with the more accurate continuous Monte Carlo Sobolev approach, as well as with the commonly used expansion-opacity formalism

authors: N. Fraija, D. Lopez-Camara, A.C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, P. Veres, S. Dichiara
topic: We calculate the light curves obtained from an analytic model in which the synchrotron and SSC emission (in the fast- or slow-cooling regime) of an off-axis top-hat jet and a quasi-spherical outflow are decelerated in either a homogeneous or a wind-like circumburst medium. We show that the synchrotron emission of the quasi-spherical outflow is stronger than that of the off-axis jet during the first \sim 10 - 20 days, and weaker during the next \geq 80 days. For GRB 170817A, we find using our model that the synchrotron emission generated by the quasi-spherical outflow and off-axis top-hat jet increase.

Our models that fit the bolometric luminosity of AT 2017gfo (the kilonova associated with the first neutron star merger discovered in gravitational waves, GW170817) do not simultaneously fit the B, V, and I time evolution. However, we find that the trends of the evolution in B and V magnitudes are better matched by the fallback model relative to the pulsar model, implying the time dependence of the remnant source influences the color evolution.

To parameterize the nuclear EoS, we use a different approach, expanding from pure nuclear matter rather than from symmetric nuclear matter to make use of recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations.

In this case, in fact, the merger remnant has an excess angular momentum yielding a more extended and "colder" object, with reduced ability to shed mass dynamically.

Abundance patterns and rates of nuclear energy production. We show that the accumulation of fissioning material during the r process can strongly affect the free neutron abundance after the r-process freeze-out. This leads to a significant impact on the abundances of heavy nuclei that undergo α decay or spontaneous fission, affecting the radioactive energy production by the ejecta at timescales relevant for kilonova emission.

The very low-Ye, fission-cycling ejecta of an r-process event need only constitute 10-30% of the total ejecta mass to accommodate most actinide abundances of metal-poor stars. We find that our empirical Ye distributions of ejecta are similar to those inferred from studies of GW170817 mass ejecta ratios, which is consistent with neutron-star mergers being a source of the heavy elements in metal-poor, r-process enhanced stars.

topic: Here, we perform a set of simulations of low-mass NSBH mergers, including systems compatible with GW170817. Our simulations use a composition and temperature dependent equation of state (DD2) and approximate neutrino transport, but no magnetic fields. We find that low-mass NSBH mergers produce remnant disks significantly less massive than previously expected, and consistent with the post-merger outflow mass inferred from GW170817 for moderately asymmetric mass ratio. The dynamical ejecta produced by systems compatible with GW170817 is negligible except if the mass ratio and black hole spin are at the edge of the allowed parameter space. That dynamical ejecta is cold, neutron-rich, and surprisingly slow for ejecta produced during the tidal disruption of a neutron star.

topic: Although high-energy neutrinos were not detected from this event, mergers of neutron stars are expected to produce such high-energy particles. Relativistic jets are launched when neutron stars merge. If the jets contain protons, they can emit high-energy neutrinos through photomeson production. In addition, neutron star mergers produce massive and fast ejecta, which can be a source of Galactic high-energy cosmic rays above the knee.

title: Constraints on Gamma-ray Burst Inner Engines in a Blandford-Znajek Framework
authors: Nicole M. Lloyd-Ronning, Chris Fryer, Jonah Miller, Neelima Prasad, Chris Torres, Phillip Martin
topic: Under the assumption that a Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) is ultimately produced by a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet from a highly spinning black hole BH, we put limits on the magnetic field and BH mass needed to power observed long and short GRBs. For BHs in the range. We also discuss the implications and consequences of high magnetic fields in GRB BH-disk systems, in terms of MRI field growth and magnetically arrested disks. Finally, we examine the conditions under which the progenitor systems can retain enough angular momentum to create BHs spinning rapidly enough to power BZ jets.

We provide the linear solution for the KHI with smooth initial conditions in three different limits: inviscid hydrodynamics, ideal MHD and Braginskii-MHD. These linear solutions are obtained numerically with the framework Psecas (Pseudo-Spectral Eigenvalue Calculator with an Automated Solver), which generates and solves numerical eigenvalue problems using an equation-parser and pseudo-spectral methods.

This universality of the late time behavior is due to the weak dependence of the ionization loss rate on composition and on e\mp energy. .

title: Misaligned snowplough effect and the electromagnetic counterpart to black hole binary mergers
authors: Fabrícia A. C. Pereira, Giuseppe Lodato, Irapuan Rodrigues, Márcio E. S. Alves, Daniel J. Price
topic: We estimate the accretion rates produced when a circumprimary gas disc is pushed into the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH) by the tidal force of the decaying secondary during a SMBH merger. Using the 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We find that discs with small inclination angles (\leq 10 degrees) produce an increase in luminosity exceeding the Eddington rate. we show that the misaligned snowplough effect remains important even for angles larger than the disc aspect ratio. The rise in the accretion rate produced by discs inclined at small angles to the binary orbit can produce an electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational wave signal emitted from final stages of the binary orbital decay.

title: Bayesian Analysis on the X-ray Spectra of the Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817
authors: En-Tzu Lin, Hoi-Fung Yu, Albert K.H. Kong
topic: For the first time, we present a Bayesian time-resolved spectral study of the X-ray afterglow datasets of GW170817/GRB17017A observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  While our results are consistent with the other works using Cash statistic within uncertainty, the Bayesian analysis we performed in this work have yielded Gaussian-like parameter distributions. We also obtained the parameter uncertainties directly from their posterior probability distributions. The X-ray flux has been fading since \sim160 days after the merger and has returned to the level as first discovered after one year. Our result shows that the X-ray spectrum of GW170817/GRB170817A is well-described by a simple power-law originated from non-thermal slow-cooling synchrotron radiation.

title: Discrete and Continuous Ejection Models of the Radio Source Associated with GW170817

topic: the discrete region includes all of the radio flux, and there is likely a synchrotron self absorption (SSA) spectral turnover. The velocity can constrain the kinematics and the SSA turnover has been used to constrain the size to much smaller than can be done with an unresolved VLBI image, allowing one to estimate the associated plasmoid size directly from the data and improve estimates of the energetics. Models of the radio emission for both a turbulent, protonic, discrete ballistic ejection and a high dissipation region within an otherwise invisible Poynting flux dominated positron-electron jet are considered. Even though only valid after day 110, this independent analysis augments traditional GRB light curve studies, providing additional constraints on the merger event.

We also show that these equations can be written as a first-order symmetric hyperbolic system, implying local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the equations of motion. We use an arbitrary equation of state and do not make any simplifying symmetry or near-equilibrium assumption, requiring only physically natural conditions on the fields. These results pave the way for the inclusion of bulk viscosity effects in simulations of gravitational-wave signals coming from neutron star mergers.

authors: Kai-Kai Duan, Zhi-Ping Jin, Fu-Wen Zhang, Yi-Ming Zhu, Xiang Li, Yi-Zhong Fan, Da-Ming Wei
topic:  the afterglow emission of the bright sGRBs and GW170817/GRB 170817A form a natural and continuous sequence, though separated by an observation time gap. If viewed on-axis, the forward shock afterglow emission of GW170817/GRB 170817A would be among the brightest ones detected so far. This provides a strong evidence for the GW170817-like merger origin of bright sGRBs, and suggests that the detection of the forward shock afterglow emission of most neutron star merger events are more challenging than the case of GW170817 since usually the mergers will be more distant and the viewing angles are plausibly higher.

authors: Andrei M. Beloborodov, Christoffer Lundman, Yuri Levin
topic: We suggest that neutron star mergers eject an ultra-relativistic envelope of mass 1e10-7 Msun, which helps explain the gamma-ray burst from GW170817. One ejection mechanism is the ablation of the neutron star surface by the burst of neutrinos in the first 30 microsec.  Another, more efficient, mechanism for inflating the ultra-relativistic envelope is an internal shock in the massive ejecta from the merger. A strong shock is expected if the merger product is a magnetar, which emits a centrifugally accelerated wind.

topic: However, these models generate local cosmic NS-NS merger rate in old host galaxies that are below the LIGO/Virgo estimate. The reason behind this tension is the predicted delay time distribution between star formation and NS-NS mergers that favors short delays. However, we show that such distribution is consistent with observations of Galactic NS-NS binaries; 50% of which show very long merger times (much longer than Hubble time). Once model distributions are convolved with continuous prolonged (10 Gyr) star formation in the Galactic disk, then 20-70% (depending on a model) of the predicted NS-NS population has very long current Galactic merger times

authors: Dhruv Desai, Brian D. Metzger, Francois Foucart
topic: One source of late-time engine activity is fall-back accretion of bound tidal ejecta. Here, we re-examine the impact of heating due to rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis on rate of the fall-back accretion, using ejecta properties obtained from numerical relativity simulations of NS-BH mergers in a toy model for the dynamical influence of nuclear heating. Depending on the mass of the remnant black hole, r-process heating can imprint a variety of fall-back curve shapes, ranging from temporal lulls of up to tens of seconds to complete late-time cut-off in the fall-back rate. This behavior is robust to realistic variations in the nuclear heating experienced by different parts of the ejecta.

In particular, we investigate the effect of the kick velocities that neutron star binaries receive upon their formation, in the building block galaxies (BBs) that partly formed the stellar halo by merging with our Galaxy.  We conclude that our assumption of instantaneous mixing is most likely inaccurate for modelling the r-process enrichment of the Galactic halo, or an additional production site for r-process elements is necessary to explain the presence of low-metallicity halo stars with high Eu abundances.

We perform an extensive analysis of the features of the phase transition leading twin-star configurations and, at the same time, fulfilling the constraints coming from the maximum mass 2Msun information following gravitational-wave event GW170817. Finally, combining all observational information available, we set constraints on the parameters that characterise the phase transition, the maximum masses, and the radii of 1.4Msun stars described by equations of state leading to twin-star configurations.

topic: SMBH, which acts as a perturber and may enhance BH and NS mergers via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We follow-up previous studies, but for the first time perform an extensive statistical study of BH-BH, NS-NS and BH-NS binary mergers by means of direct high-precision regularized N-body. We also compare our results to the secular approximation, and show that N-body simulations generally predict a larger number of mergers. Finally, these events can also be observable via their electromagnetic counterparts, thus making these compact object mergers especially valuable for cosmological and astrophysical purposes.

topic: shows that apart from being particularly sensitive to the common envelope treatment, DNS merger rates appear rather robust against variations of several factors probed in their study (e.g. conservativeness of the mass transfer, angular momentum loss, and natal kicks), unless extreme assumptions are made. Confrontation with the improving observational limits may allow to rule out some of the extreme models.

title: Hypermassive Neutron Star Disk Outflows and Blue Kilonovae
authors: Steven Fahlman, Rodrigo Fernández
topic: We study mass ejection from accretion disks around newly-formed hypermassive neutron stars (HMNS). Standard kilonova model fits to GW170817 require at least a lanthanide-poor ('blue') and lanthanide-rich ('red') component. but average disk outflow velocities from existing long-term HMNS simulations fall short of the inferred value 0.25c.  Here we use time-dependent, axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of HMNS disks to explore the limits of the model and its ability to account for observations. For physically plausible parameter choices compatible with GW170817, we find that hydrodynamic models that use shear viscosity to transport angular momentum cannot eject matter with mass-averaged velocities larger than \sim 0.15c. While outflow velocities in our simulations can exceed the asymptotic value for a steady-state neutrino-driven wind, the increase in the average velocity due to viscosity is not sufficient. Therefore, viscous HMNS disk winds cannot reproduce by themselves the ejecta properties inferred from multi-component fits to kilonova light curves from GW170817

title: Analysis of the duration--hardness ratio plane of gamma-ray bursts using skewed distributions
authors: Mariusz Tarnopolski
topic: existance of an intermedate GRB, between sGRB and lGRB, by analysing statistics of GRB. It is found that the best description is given by a two-component mixture of skewed Student-t distributions, which outperforms any other model considered. This implies that the distribution of the studied parameters is intrinsically skewed, introducing spurious Gaussian components, and hence the third class is unlikely to be a real phenomenon. Its existence, based on statistical inference, is therefore rejected as unnecessary to explain the observations.

authors: Yuan-Zhu Wang, Dong-Sheng Shao, Jin-Liang Jiang, Shao-Peng Tang, Xiao-Xiao Ren, Fu-Wen Zhang, Zhi-Ping Jin, Yi-Zhong Fan, Da-Ming Wei 
topic: In this work we use the results of these modeling (off-axis energetic relativistic outflow component launched) to examine the energy extraction process of the central engine. We show that the magnetic process (i.e., the Blandford-Znajek mechanism) is favored, while the neutrino process usually requires a too massive accretion disk if the duration of the central engine activity is comparable to the observed. We propose that the GRB observations are helpful to constrain the combined tidal parameter by adopting the accretion disk mass distribution estimated in BZ mechanism.

The merger of neutron stars would leave behind a short pulse of electromagnetic synchrotron radiation even if the neutrino jet in the merger points away from the neutrino detectors.

authors: K. P. Mooley, D. A. Frail, D. Dobie, E. Lenc, A. Corsi, K. De, A.J. Nayana, S. Makhathini, I. Heywood et al
topic: We present new 0.6-10 GHz observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 covering the period up to 300 days post-merger, taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and the MeerKAT telescope. Such a slope cannot be produced by a quasi-isotropic (cocoon-dominated) outflow, but is instead the classic signature of a relativistic jet. This provides strong observational evidence that GW170817 produced a successful jet, and directly demonstrates the link between binary neutron star mergers and short-hard GRBs. Using simple analytical arguments, we derive constraints on the geometry and the jet opening angle of GW170817. These results are consistent with those from our companion Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) paper, reporting superluminal motion in GW170817.

topic: We combine gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) data to perform a Bayesian parameter estimation of the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817. The EM likelihood is constructed from a fit to a large number of numerical relativity simulations which we combine with a lower bound on the mass of the remnant's accretion disk inferred from the modeling of the EM light curve. In comparison with previous works, our analysis yields a more precise determination of the tidal deformability of the binary, for which the EM data provide a lower bound, and of the mass ratio of the binary, with the EM data favoring a smaller mass asymmetry.

title: Jet launching from binary black hole-neutron star mergers: Dependence on black hole spin, binary mass ratio and magnetic field orientation
authors: Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro, Antonios Tsokaros
topic: sing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNS undergoing merger we showed that a magnetically--driven jet can be launched by the remnant if the NS is endowed with a dipole B field extending from the interior into the exterior as in a radio pulsar. Here, as a crucial step in establishing BHNS systems as viable progenitors of central engines that power short gamma--ray bursts (sGRBs) and thereby solidify their role as multimessenger sources, we survey different BHNS configurations that differ in BH spin. By the time we terminate our simulations, we do not observe either an outflow or a large-scale B field collimation in the other configurations we simulate. These results suggest that future multimessenger detections from BHNSs are more likely produced by binaries with highly spinning BH companions and small tilt-angle B fields.

authors: Z. G. Dai
topic: In this paper, we have investigated rotation-induced gravitational radiation from possibly existing, radially oscillating pulsars after binary neutron star mergers, and find that this mechanism can efficiently damp the radial oscillations. The resulting gravitational waves (GWs) could have a non-negligible contribution to the high-frequency spectrum. We provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of the event rate and suggest that such GW events would be detectable with the advanced LIGO/Virgo or next-generation detectors. Our discussion can also be applied to newborn, radially oscillating, millisecond pulsars formed through the other astrophysical processes.

topic: We show that a long-lived magnetized NS with a poloidal field is fully consistent with the electromagnetic dataset, when spin down losses are dominated by gravitational wave (GW) emission. The required ellipticity can result from a toroidal magnetic field component much stronger than the poloidal component, a configuration expected from a NS newly formed from a merger. Abrupt magnetic dissipation of the toroidal component can lead to the appearance of X-ray flares, analogous to the one observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. we identify a low-significance  temporal feature at 155 d, consistent with a sudden reactivation of the central NS. Energy injection from the NS spin down into the relativistic shock is negligible, and the underlying continuum is fully accounted for by a structured jet seen off-axis.

title: r-process enrichment of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies by fast merging double neutron stars
authors: Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Jeff. J. Andrews, Tassos Fragos, Phillip Macias, Evan Scannapieco
topic: However, it is difficult to reconcile the large natal kicks and long average merging times of Double Neutron Stars (DNSs), with the levels of r-process enrichment seen in ultra faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies such as Reticulum II and Tucana III. Assuming that such dwarf systems have lost a significant fraction of their stellar mass through tidal stripping, we conclude that contrary to most current models, it is the DNSs with rather large natal kicks but very short merging timescales that can enrich UFD-type galaxies. These binaries are either on highly eccentric orbits, or form with very short separations due to an additional mass-transfer between the first-born neutron star and a naked helium star, progenitor of the second-born neutron star. These DNSs are born with a frequency that agrees with the statistics of the r-process UFDs, and merge well within the virial radius of their host halos, therefore contributing significantly to their r-process enrichment.

title: Critical Tests Of Leading Gamma Ray Burst Theories 
authors: Shlomo Dado, Arnon Dar
topic: The two leading theoretical models of GRBs and their afterglows, the fireball model and the cannonball model, have been widely confronted with the mounting observational data on GRBs and SHBs during the last two decades. Both have claimed success in reproducing the observational data, despite their complexity and diversity. This claimed success, however, may reflect multiple choices and the use of many free adjustable parameters, rather than the true validity of the models. Only confrontation of the key falsifiable predictions of the models with solid observational data can test their validity. Such critical tests are summarized in this report. Conclusions left to the reader.

title: Nonthermal afterglow of the binary neutron star merger GW170817: a more natural modeling of electron energy distribution leads to a qualitatively different new solution
authors: Haoxiang Lin, Tomonori Totani, Kenta Kiuchi
topic: nonthermal afterglow  -- synchrotron radiation by shock-accelerated electrons. Assumption:  all electrons in the shock are accelerated as a nonthermal population, affecting the peak frequency of the afterglow spectrum. Here we present Bayesian fitting to the observed data with a more natural electron energy distribution, in which the acceleration efficiency is a free parameter. Interestingly, the maximum likelihood solutions are found with radio flux below numax in the early phase, in contrast to previous studies that found the radio frequency always above numax. The jet energy and interstellar medium density are increased by 1--2 orders of magnitude from the conventional modeling, though these are still consistent with other constraints.

title: Pre-merger electromagnetic counterparts of binary compact stars
authors: Jie-Shuang Wang, Fang-Kun Peng, Kinwah Wu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: We investigate emission signatures of binary compact star gravitational wave sources consisting of strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs) and/or white dwarfs (WDs) in their late-time inspiral phase. Because of electromagnetic interactions between the magnetospheres of the two compact stars, a substantial amount of energy will be extracted in the last few seconds before the two stars merge, when the binary system contains a NS with a surface magnetic field 10 to 12 gauss. The induced electric field in the process can accelerate charged particles up to the EeV energy range. Synchrotron radiation is emitted from energetic electrons, with radiative energies reaching the GeV energy for binary NSs and the MeV energy for NS - WD or double WD binaries. In addition, a blackbody component is also presented and it peaks at several to hundreds keV for binary NSs and at several keV for NS - WD or double WD binaries. The strong angular dependence of the synchrotron radiation and the isotropic nature of the blackbody radiation lead to distinguishable modulation patterns between the two emission components. If coherent curvature radiation is presented, fast radio bursts could be produced.

title: The neutron star merger GW170817 points to collapsars as the main r-process source
authors: Daniel M. Siegel, Jennifer Barnes, Brian D. Metzger
topic: Here we show that collapsar accretion disks also produce neutron-rich outflows that synthesize heavy r-process nuclei, despite the comparatively proton-rich composition of the infalling star. Though occurring less frequently than mergers, the much greater accreted mass in collapsars---and their correspondingly larger disk wind ejecta---implicate them as dominant contributors to the Galactic r-process. Collapsars provide the rare r-process source needed to promptly enrich a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies early in the Universe which is also compatible with the Galactic chemical enrichment of europium relative to iron over longer timescales. We predict an excess in the late-time near-infrared emission from GRB supernovae, testable by future observations.

authors: David Radice, Albino Perego, Kenta Hotokezaka, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Steven A. Fromm, Luke F. Roberts
topic: General-relativistic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with viscosity reveal a new outflow mechanism operating in unequal mass binaries on dynamical timescales and enabled by turbulent viscosity. These "viscous-dynamical" ejecta are launched during merger due to the thermalization of mass exchange streams between the secondary and the primary neutron star. They are characterized by asymptotic velocities extending up to 0.8c. The radioactive decay of the expanding viscous-dynamical ejecta could produce bright kilonova transients with signatures of free neutron decay in the first hour and enhanced near infrared flux on a timescale of a few days. The synchrotron remnant produced by the interaction between the ejecta and the interstellar medium could also be significantly enhanced by viscosity. Such remnant could be detected in the case of GW170817 as a rebrightening of the radio signal in the next months to years.

We examine both simple isolated dwarf disc galaxies and cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-type galaxies, and compare the (Eu/Fe) and (Eu/{\alpha}) evolution with recent observations, including the HERMES-GALAH survey. We find that neither electron-capture supernovae or neutrino-driven winds are able to adequately produce heavy neutron-capture elements such as Eu in quantities to match observations. Both neutron-star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae are able to produce these elements in sufficient quantities.

In thick disc stars, the ratio is found to be constant, while the and  ratios decrease as a function of the metallicity.  These observations clearly indicate a different nucleosynthesis history in the thick disc between Eu and Gd-Dy. We also find that the alpha-rich metal-rich stars are also enriched in r-process elements. his data may help to constrain chemical evolution models of Milky Way r- and s-process elements and the yields of massive stars.

title: Constraining the Outflow Structure of the Binary Neutron Star Merger Event GW170817 with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Analysis
authors: Yiyang Wu, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We utilize a physically motivated analytic two-parameter model called the "boosted fireball" for the outflow structure after it has expanded far from the merger site and has entered the self-similar coasting phase. This model consists of a family of outflows with a structure varying smoothly between a highly collimated ultra-relativistic jet and an isotropic fireball. We simulate the dynamical evolution, starting with "boosted fireball" initial conditions, of 240 outflows using the moving-mesh relativistic hydrodynamics code JET to follow their evolution through the afterglow phase. We compute synchrotron spectra from the hydrodynamic simulations using the standard synchrotron radiation model. We develop a synthetic light curve generator with an efficient sampling speed. Our results favor the relativistic structured jet, with a jet opening angle \sim 5 deg and Lorentz factor \sim 175, viewed from an off-axis angle of 27(+9-3) deg.

topic:  it remains unclear whether and how the central engine can produce such structured jets. Here, we utilize 3D GRMHD simulations starting with a black hole surrounded by a magnetized torus with properties typically expected of a post-merger system. We follow the jet, as it is self-consistently launched, from the scale of the compact object out to more than 3 orders of magnitude in distance. We find that this naturally results in a structured jet, which is collimated by the disk wind into a half-opening angle of roughly 10 degrees, its emission can explain features of both the prompt and afterglow emission of GRB170817A for a 30 degree observing angle. Our work is the first to compute the afterglow, in the context of a binary merger, from a relativistic magnetized jet self-consistently generated by an accreting black hole, with the jet's transverse structure determined by the accretion physics and not prescribed at any point.

Our motivation is to define which astrophysical sites have significantly contributed to the total mass of r-process elements present in our Galaxy. We found discrepancies with the neutron star (NS-NS) merger scenario. One solution is to assume an extra production site of Eu that would be active in the early universe, but would fade away with increasing metallicity. If this is correct, this extra site could be responsible for roughly 50% of the Eu production in the early universe, before the onset of Type~Ia supernovae. Rare classes of supernovae could be this additional r-process source, but hydrodynamic simulations still need to ensure the conditions for a robust r-process pattern.

authors: Zhi-Qiu Huang, Liang-Duan Liu, Xiang-Yu Wang, Zi-Gao Dai
topic:  In this paper, we investigate observational signatures of kilonova emission from the anisotropic ejecta in BH-NS mergers. We find that a bump appears on the bolometric luminosity light curve due to the inhomogeneous mass distribution in the latitudinal direction. The decay slope of the single-band light curve becomes flatter and the spectrum also deviates from a single-temperature blackbody radiation spectrum due to the gradient in the velocity distribution of the ejecta. Future detection or non-detection of such signatures would be useful to test the mass ejection geometry in BH-NS mergers.

authors: Anton Motornenko, Volodymyr Vovchenko, Jan Steinheimer, Stefan Schramm, Horst Stoecker
topic: A unified chiral mean field approach is presented for QCD thermodynamics in a wide range of temperatures and densities. The model simultaneously gives a satisfactory description of lattice QCD thermodynamics and fulfills nuclear matter and astrophysical constraints. The resulting equation of state can be incorporated in relativistic fluid-dynamical simulations of heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars mergers. Access to different regions of the QCD phase diagram can be obtained in simulations of heavy-ion data and observations of neutron star mergers.

title: Delayed jet breakouts from binary neutron star mergers
authors: Tatsuya Matsumoto, Shigeo S. Kimura
topic: the jet may be choked and fails to produce a successful sGRB. We propose a "delayed breakout" scenario where a late-time jet launched by a long-term engine activity can penetrate ejecta even if a prompt jet is choked. Observationally, such a late-time jet is supported by the long-lasting high-energy emissions in sGRBs. Solving the jet propagation in ejecta, we show that a typical late-time activity easily achieves the delayed breakout.

topic: We identify an observable imprint of a first-order hadron-quark phase transition at supranuclear densities on the gravitational-wave (GW) emission of neutron star mergers. Specifically, we show that the dominant postmerger GW frequency fpeak may exhibit a significant deviation from an empirical relation between fpeak and the tidal deformability if a strong first-order phase transition leads to the formation of a gravitationally stable extended quark matter core in the postmerger remnant

title: Mergers of black hole-neutron star binaries and rates of associated electromagnetic counterparts
authors: Mukul Bhattacharya, Pawan Kumar, George Smoot
topic: Here we study the effect of the BHNS binary parameters on the merger ejecta properties and associated EM signals. We estimate the remnant disk and unbound ejecta masses for BH mass and spin distributions motivated from the observations of transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and specific NS equation of state (EoS). The amount of r-process elements synthesised in BHNS mergers is estimated to be a factor 1 -- 0.01\% of the BNS.  due to the smaller dynamical ejecta and merger rates for the former. We compute the EM luminosities and light curves for the early- and late-time emissions from the ultra-relativistic jet, sub-relativistic dynamical ejecta and wind, and the mildly-relativistic cocoon for typical ejecta parameters.

title: Fingerprints of heavy element nucleosynthesis in the late-time lightcurves of kilonovae
authors: Meng-Ru Wu, Jennifer Barnes, Gabriel Martinez-Pinedo, Brian D. Metzger
topic: At early times (~days) most of the r-process heating arises from a large statistical ensemble of beta-decays, which thermalize efficiently while the ejecta is still dense, generating a heating rate that is reasonably approximated by a single power-law. However, at later times (weeks to months), the decay energy input can possibly be dominated by a discrete number of alpha-decays following the beta-decay of 225Ra which liberate more energy per decay and thermalize with greater efficiency than beta-decay products. Late-time nebular observations of kilonovae which constrain the radioactive power provide the potential to identify signatures of these individual isotopes, thus confirming the production of heavy nuclei. In order to constrain the bolometric light to the required accuracy, multi-epoch & wide-band observations are required with sensitive instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope

title: Radioactive \gamma-Ray Emissions from Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Li-Xin Li
topic: According to the theoretical model, the optical radiation from a neutron star merger originates from the radioactive decay of unstable nuclides freshly synthesized in the merger ejecta. In about a day the ejecta transits from an optically thick state to an optically thin state due to its subrelativistic expansion. Hence, we expect that about a day after the merger, the gamma-ray photons produced by radioactive decays start to escape from the ejecta and make it bright in the MeV band. In this paper, we study the features of the radioactive gamma-ray emission from a neutron star merger, including the brightness and the spectrum, and discuss the observability of the gamma-ray emission. Under favorable conditions, a prominent pair annihilation line can be present in the gamma-ray spectrum. Requires D less 12Mpc.

topic: Here, we implement empirically derived inter-correlated distributions of initial binary parameters primary mass (M1), mass ratio (q), orbital period (P), and eccentricity (e). Unexpectedly, the introduction of inter-correlated initial binary parameters leads to only a small decrease in the predicted merger rates by a factor of 2 − 3 relative to the previously used non-correlated initial distributions. The formation of compact object mergers in the isolated classical binary evolution favors initial binaries with stars of comparable masses (q = 0.5 − 1) at intermediate orbital periods (log P (days) = 2 − 4)

Here we explore some of the observational consequences of this structured emission, taking the reconstructed angular emission profile of gamma-ray burst GRB170817A to be typical. We calculate the expected fraction of gravitational-wave observations from BNS mergers that will have an observed GRB counterpart to be \sim 30\%, implying that joint gravitational-wave and GRB observations will be common. Further, we find that \sim 10% of observed short GRBs occur within 200 Mpc. Finally, we estimate a BNS merger rate of 500

title: Are fast radio bursts the most likely electromagnetic counterpart of neutron star mergers resulting in prompt collapse?
authors: Vasileios Paschalidis, Milton Ruiz
topic: Moreover, we find that most models of the BNS mass function we study here predict that the majority of prompt-collapse BNS mergers have q greater 0.8. Prompt-collapse BNS mergers with mass ratio may not be accompanied by detectable kilonovae or short gamma-ray bursts, because they unbind a negligible amount of mass and form negligibly small accretion disks onto the remnant black hole. We call such BNS mergers "orphan". Through simulations in full general relativity of BNSs endowed with an initial dipole magnetosphere, we find that the energy in the magnetosphere following black hole formation is  in 1 ms, as has been found in previous studies, matches the premerger magnetospheric luminosity. These magnetospheric signals are not beamed, and their duration and power agrees with those of non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs).

title: Physical conditions for the r-process I. radioactive energy sources of kilonovae
authors: Shinya Wanajo
topic: In previous studies power-law-type heating rates have frequently been used, which may be inadequate if the ejecta are dominated by nuclei other than the A ~ 130 region. We consider, therefore, two reference abundance distributions that match the r-process residuals to the solar abundances for A above 69 (light trans-iron plus r-process elements) and A above 90 (r-process elements). Nucleosynthetic abundances are obtained by using free-expansion models with three parameters: expansion velocity, entropy, and electron fraction. Radioactive energies are calculated as an ensemble of weighted free-expansion models that reproduce the reference abundance patterns. The results are compared with the bolometric luminosity (above a few days since merger) of the kilonova associated with GW170817. If this is the case, the event GW170817 is best explained by the production of both light trans-iron and r-process elements that originate from dynamical ejecta and subsequent disk outflows from the neutron star merger.

title: Stochastic Chemical Evolution of Galactic Subhalos and the Origin of r-Process Elements
authors: Takuya Ojima, Yuhri Ishimaru, Shinya Wanajo, Nikos Prantzos, Patrick Francois
topic: the average coalescence timescale of NSMs appears to be > 100 Myr. most of previous chemical evolution models indicate that the observed early appearance and large dispersion of [r/Fe] in Galactic halo stars at [Fe/H] less -2.5 favors shorter coalescence times of 1-10 Myr. We argue that this is not the case for the models assuming the formation of the Galactic halo from clustering of subhalos with different star formation histories as suggested by Ishimaru et al. (2015). We present a stochastic chemical evolution model of the subhalos, in which the site of the r-process is assumed to be mainly NSMs with a coalescence timescale of 100 Myr.  Our results show that the less massive subhalos evolve at lower metallicities and generate highly r-process-enhanced stars. An assembly of these subhalos leaves behind the large star-to-star scatters of [r/Fe] in the Galactic halo as observed. However, the observed scatters of [Sr/Ba] at low metallicities indicate the presence of an additional site that partially contributes to the enrichment of light neutron-capture elements such as Sr.

authors: G. Ghirlanda, O. S. Salafia, Z. Paragi, A. Perego, et al
topic: The binary neutron star merger event GW170817 was detected through both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. Its afterglow emission may have been produced by either a narrow relativistic jet or an isotropic outflow. High spatial resolution measurements of the source size and displacement can discriminate between these scenarios. We present Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations, performed 207.4 days after the merger, using a global network of 32 radio telescopes. The apparent source size is constrained to be smaller than 2.5 milliarcseconds at the 90% confidence level. This excludes the isotropic outflow scenario, which would have produced a larger apparent size, indicating that GW170817 produced a structured relativistic jet.

authors: Rodrigo Fernández, Alexander Tchekhovskoy, Eliot Quataert, Francois Foucart, Daniel Kasen
topic: We investigate the long-term evolution of black hole accretion disks formed in neutron star mergers. These disks expel matter that contributes to an r-process kilonova, and can produce relativistic jets powering short gamma-ray bursts. Here we report the results of a three-dimensional, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of such a disk which is evolved for long enough 6s to achieve completion of mass ejection far from the disk. Our model starts with a poloidal field, and fully resolves the most unstable mode of the magnetorotational instability. We parameterize the dominant microphysics and neutrino cooling effects, and compare with axisymmetric hydrodynamic models with shear viscosity. The GRMHD model ejects mass in two ways: a prompt MHD-mediated outflow and a late-time, thermally-driven wind once the disk becomes advective. The total amount of unbound mass ejected (0.013Msun, or \approx 40\% of the initial torus mass) is twice as much as in hydrodynamic models, with higher average velocity (0.1c) and a broad electron fraction distribution with a lower average value (0.16).

authors: Ricard Ardevol-Pulpillo, H.-Thomas Janka, Oliver Just, Andreas Bauswein
topic: We present a new, computationally efficient, energy-integrated approximation for neutrino effects in hot and dense astrophysical environments such as supernova cores and compact binary mergers and their remnants. Our new method, termed ILEAS for Improved Leakage-Equilibration-Absorption Scheme, improves the lepton-number and energy losses of traditional leakage descriptions by a novel prescription of the diffusion time-scale based on a detailed energy integral of the flux-limited diffusion equation. The leakage module is supplemented by a neutrino-equilibration treatment that ensures the proper evolution of the total lepton number and medium plus neutrino energies as well as neutrino-pressure effects in the neutrino-trapping domain. Moreover, we employ a simple and straightforwardly applicable ray-tracing algorithm for including re-absorption of escaping neutrinos especially in the decoupling layer and during the transition to semi-transparent conditions. ILEAS is implemented on a three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian grid with a minimum of free and potentially case-dependent parameters and exploits the basic physics constraints that should be fulfilled in the neutrino-opaque and free-streaming limits.

topic:  Simulations of r-process nucleosynthesis, so far fail to account for the observed over-enhancement of actinides. In this work, we investigate actinide production in the dynamical ejecta of a neutron star merger and explore if varying levels of neutron richness can reproduce the actinide boost. We also investigate the sensitivity of actinide production on nuclear physics properties: fission distribution, beta-decay, and mass model. For most cases, the actinides are over-produced in our models if the initial conditions are sufficiently neutron-rich for fission cycling. We find that actinide production can be so robust in the dynamical ejecta that an additional lanthanide-rich, actinide-poor component is necessary in order to match observations of actinide-boost stars. We present a simple actinide-dilution model that folds in estimated contributions from two nucleosynthetic sites within a merger event. Our study suggests that while the dynamical ejecta of a neutron star merger is a likely production site for the formation of actinides, a significant contribution from another site or sites (e.g., the neutron star merger accretion disk wind) is required to explain abundances of r-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars.

This calculation is performed using the same EoS for merger components and for low spin prior case. It is found from the computations of tidal deformability parameters that soft to moderately stiff equations of state are allowed by the 50\% and 90\% credible regions obtained from the gravitational wave observation of binary neutron star merger GW170817, whereas the stiffest hadron-quark EoS which lies above the upper 90% limit, is ruled out. A correlation among the tidal deformabilities and masses is found to exist as already predicted. Furthermore moments of inertia and quadrupole moments of merger components of GW170817 are estimated.

We then combine the H0 values from all the galaxies to provide a final measurement of H0. We explore the dependence of our results on the thresholds by which galaxies are included in our sample, as well as the impact of weighting the galaxies by stellar mass and star-formation rate.

In this paper, we propose that the polarimetric observation can be a useful tool to study the early macronova emissions.

authors: L. Jens Papenfort, Roman Gold, Luciano Rezzolla
topic:  we investigate the dynamics, gravitational-wave emission, and nucleosynthetic yields of numerous eccentric binary neutron-star mergers having different equations of state. For each equation of state we vary the orbital properties around th we couple the dynamical ejecta output from the simulations to the nuclear-reaction network code \texttt{SkyNet} to compute nucleosynthetic yields and compare to the corresponding results in the case of a quasi-circular merger. We find that the amount and velocity of dynamically ejected material is always much larger than in the quasi-circular case, reaching maximal valuese threshold of immediate merger, as well as the binary mass ratio. At the same time, the properties of this material are rather insensitive to the details of the orbit. urthermore, while the composition of the ejected matter depends on the orbital parameters and on the equation of state, the relative nucleosynthetic yields do not, thus indicating that kilonova signatures could provide information on the orbital properties of dynamically captured neutron-star binaries.

topic: We present detailed chemical abundances of three new bright (V ~ 11), extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] ~ -3.0), r-process-enhanced halo red giants based on high-resolution, high-S/N Magellan/MIKE spectra. We measured abundances for 20-25 neutron-capture elements in each of our stars. All three stars show remarkable agreement with the scaled solar r-process pattern for elements above Ba, consistent with enrichment of the birth gas cloud by a neutron star merger. The abundances for Sr, Y, and Zr, however, deviate from the scaled solar pattern. This indicates that more than one distinct r-process site might be responsible for the observed neutron-capture element abundance pattern. Thorium was detected in J1432-4125 and J2005-3057. Age estimates for J1432-4125 and J2005-3057 were adopted from one of two sets of initial production ratios each by assuming the stars are old.

topic:  The luminosity of kilonova light curves depends on the efficiency with which beta-decay electrons are thermalized in the ejecta. Here we derive a simple analytic solution for thermalization by calculating how electrons accumulate in the ejecta and lose energy adiabatically and via plasma losses. We find that the time-dependent thermalization efficiency is well described by [law] is a function of the ejecta mass and velocity. For a statistical distribution of r-process isotopes with radioactive power [law] the late time kilonova luminosity asymptotes to [law] depends super-linearly on the ejecta mass [law] If a kilonova is instead powered by a single dominate isotope, we show that the late time luminosity can deviate substantially from the underlying exponential decay and eventually become brighter than the instantaneous radioactivity due to the accumulation of trapped electrons. Applied to the kilonova associated with the gravitational wave source GW170817, these results imply that a possible steepening of the observed light curve at ≳7 days is unrelated to thermalization effects and instead could mark the onset of translucency in a high opacity component of ejecta. The analytic results should be convenient for estimating the properties of observed kilonovae and assessing the potential late time detectability of future events.

title: The Location and Environments of Neutron Star Mergers in an Evolving Universe
authors: Brandon K. Wiggins, Christopher L. Fryer, Joseph M. Smidt, Dieter H. Hartmann, Nicole Lloyd-Ronning, Chris Belcynski
topic: While long-duration GRBs originate from massive stars and thus are located near their stellar nurseries, binary neutron stars may merge on much longer timescales, and thus may have had time to migrate appreciably. The strength and character of the electromagnetic afterglow emission of binary neutron star mergers is a sensitive function of the circum-merger environment. Though the explosion sites of short GRBs have been explored in the literature, the question has yet to be fully addressed in its cosmological context. We present cosmological simulations following the evolution of a galaxy cluster including star formation combined with binary population synthesis models to self-consistently track the locations and environmental gas densities of compact binary merger sites throughout the cosmic web. We present probability distributions for densities as a function of redshift and discuss model sensitivity to population synthesis model assumptions.

title: Remnant baryon mass outside of the black hole after a neutron star-black hole merger
authors: Francois Foucart, Tanja Hinderer, Samaya Nissanke
topic: Gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals from the merger of a Neutron Star (NS) and a Black Hole (BH) are a highly anticipated discovery in extreme gravity, nuclear-, and astrophysics. We develop a simple formula that distinguishes between merger outcomes and predicts the post-merger remnant mass, validated with 75 simulations. Our formula improves on existing results by describing critical unexplored regimes: comparable masses and higher BH spins. These are important to differentiate NSNS from NSBH mergers, and to infer source physics from EM signals

title: Late afterglows of GW/GRB 170817A
authors: Houri Ziaeepour
topic: In a previous work we used a phenomenological formulation of relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission to analyse the prompt gamma-ray emission of GW/GRB 170817A. Here we use the same model to analyse late afterglows of this event. The main goal is to see whether synchrotron emission alone can explain late afterglows. This is true, if the synchrotron self-absorption of radio emission and extinction of optical/IR photons are taken into account. Alternatively, an additional source of X-ray is necessary to explain the data. These conclusions are independent of the model used here and can be deduced directly from data. We also show that at the time of its encounter with circumburst material the outflow could have been still mildly magnetized.

topic: Here we show that GRB150101B was an analogue of GRB170817A located at a cosmological distance. GRB 150101B was a faint short duration GRB characterized by a bright optical counterpart and a long-lived X-ray afterglow. These properties are unusual for standard short GRBs and are instead consistent with an explosion viewed off-axis: the optical light is produced by a luminous kilonova component, while the observed X-rays trace the GRB afterglow viewed at an angle of \sim 13 degrees. Our findings suggest that these properties could be common among future electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources.

title: Jet Dynamics in Compact Object Mergers: GW170817 Likely had a Successful Jet
authors: Paul C. Duffell, Eliot Quataert, Daniel Kasen, Hannah Klion
topic: We use relativistic hydrodynamic numerical calculations to study the interaction between a jet and a homologous outflow produced dynamically during binary neutron star mergers. We quantify how the thermal energy supplied by the jet to the ejecta and the ability of a jet to escape the homologous ejecta depend on the parameters of the jet engine and the ejecta. For collimated jets initiated at early times compared to the engine duration, we show that successful breakout of the forward cocoon shock necessitates a jet that successfully escapes the ejecta. This is because the ejecta is expanding and absorbing thermal energy, so that the forward shock from a failed jet stalls before it reaches the edge of the ejecta. This conclusion can be circumvented only for very energetic wide angle jets, with parameters that are uncomfortable given short-duration GRB observations. For successful jets, we find two regimes of jet breakout from the ejecta, early breakout on timescales shorter than the engine duration, and late breakout well after the engine shuts off. A late breakout can explain the observed delay between gravitational waves and gamma rays in GW 170817.

authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Ehud Nakar, Ore Gottlieb, Samaya Nissanke, Kento Masuda, Gregg Hallinan, Kunal P. Mooley, Adam. T. Deller
topic: In this analysis, the degeneracy in the GW signal between the source distance and the weakly constrained viewing angle dominated the H0 measurement uncertainty. ecently, Mooley et al. (2018) obtained tight constraints on the viewing angle using high angular resolution imaging of the radio counterpart of GW170817. Here we obtain a significantly improved measurement H0=68.9+4.7−4.6 km/s/Mpc by using these new radio observations, combined with the previous GW and EM data. We estimate that 15 more localized GW170817-like events (comparable signal-to-noise ratio, favorable orientation), having radio images and light curve data, will potentially bring resolution to the tension between the Planck and Cepheid-supernova measurements, as compared to 50-100 GW events without such data.

title: Elastic Scattering in General Relativistic Ray Tracing for Neutrinos
authors: M. Brett Deaton, Evan O'Connor, Y. L. Zhu, Andy Bohn, Jerred Jesse, Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, G. C. McLaughlin
topic: We present a covariant ray tracing algorithm for computing high-resolution neutrino distributions in general relativistic numerical spacetimes with hydrodynamical sources. Our formulation treats the very important effect of elastic scattering of neutrinos off of nuclei and nucleons (changing the neutrino's direction but not energy) by incorporating estimates of the background neutrino fields. Background fields provide information about the spectra and intensities of the neutrinos scattered into each ray. These background fields may be taken from a low-order moment simulation or be ignored, in which case the method reduces to a standard state-of-the-art ray tracing formulation. The method handles radiation in regimes spanning optically thick to optically thin.

title: Californium-254 and kilonova light curves
authors: Y. Zhu, R. T. Wollaeger, N. Vassh, et al
topic: We have performed dynamical nucleosynthesis calculations and identified a single isotope, 254Cf, which has a particularly high impact on the brightness of electromagnetic transients associated with mergers on the order of 15 to 250 days. This is due to the anomalously long half-life of this isotope and the efficiency of fission thermalization compared to other nuclear channels. We estimate the fission fragment yield of this nucleus and outline the astrophysical conditions under which 254Cf has the greatest impact to the light curve. Future observations in the middle-IR which are bright during this regime could indicate the production of actinide nucleosynthesis.

authors: K. P. Mooley, A. T. Deller, O. Gottlieb, E. Nakar, G. Hallinan, S. Bourke , D.A. Frail, A. Horesh, A. Corsi, K. Hotokezaka
topic: To date, various models have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a choked-jet cocoon and a successful-jet cocoon (a.k.a. structured jet). However, the observational data have remained inconclusive as to whether GW170817 launched a successful relativistic jet. Here we show, through Very Long Baseline Interferometry, that the compact radio source associated with GW170817 exhibits superluminal motion between two epochs at 75 and 230 days post-merger. This measurement breaks the degeneracy between the models and indicates that, while the early-time radio emission was powered by a wider-angle outflow (cocoon), the late-time emission was most likely dominated by an energetic and narrowly-collimated jet, with an opening angle of \less 5 degrees, and observed from a viewing angle of about 20 degrees.

title: From Nuclei to the Cosmos: Tracing Heavy-Element Production with the Oldest Stars
authors: Anna Frebel
topic: Old stars found in the Milky Way and its dwarf satellite galaxies can provide answers because they preserve clean elemental patterns of the nucleosynthesis processes that operated some 13 billion years ago. This enables the reconstruction of the chemical evolution of the elements. Here we focus on the astrophysical signatures of heavy neutron-capture elements made in the s-, i- and r-process found in old stars. A highlight is the recently discovered r-process galaxy Reticulum II that was apparently enriched by a neutron star merger. These results show that old stars in dwarf galaxies provide a novel means to constrain the astrophysical site of the r-process, ushering in much needed progress on this major outstanding question.

title: Radio sky maps of the GRB 170817A afterglow from simulations
authors: Jonathan Zrake, Xiaoyi Xie, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We present synthetic radio images of the GRB170817A afterglow, computed from moving-mesh hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star merger outflows. Having expanded for nearly a year, the merger remnant is expected to subtend roughly 5 milli-arcseconds (mas) on the sky, potentially resolvable by very long baseline radio imaging techniques. Any observations revealing the radio centroid to be offset from the line-of-site to the merger would be the smoking gun of a jetted outflow. We find that in both scenarios, the centroid exhibits superluminal proper motion away from the merger site at roughly 4 - 10 mas per day for at least the first 300 days. We argue that a successful strategy for differentiating among the explosion models will need to include multiple observations over the coming months - years. In particular, we find the time at which the centroid attains its maximum offset, and begins heading back toward the merger site, is considerably later if the jet was choked.

title: Unveiling the Engines of Fast Radio Bursts, Super-Luminous Supernovae, and Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Ben Margalit, Brian D. Metzger, Edo Berger, Matt Nicholl, Tarraneh Eftekhari, Raffaella Margutti
topic: However, a barrier to direct confirmation of the magnetar hypothesis is the challenge of directly observing non-thermal emission from the central engine at early times (when it is most powerful and thus detectable) due to the dense surrounding ejecta. We present CLOUDY calculations of the time-dependent evolution of the temperature and ionization structure of expanding supernova or merger ejecta due to photo-ionization by a magnetar engine, in order to study the escape of X-rays (absorbed by neutral gas) and radio waves (absorbed by ionized gas), as well as to assess the evolution of the local dispersion measure due to photo-ionization. We find that ionization breakout does not occur if the engine's ionizing luminosity decays rapidly, and that X-rays typically escape the oxygen-rich ejecta of SLSNe only on \sim 100yr timescales, consistent with current X-ray non-detections. We apply these results to constrain engine-driven models for the binary NS merger GW170817 and the luminous transient ASASSN-15lh.

title: On GW170817 and the Galactic Binary Neutron Star Population
authors: Chris Pankow
topic: Electromagnetic observations and model fitting of the ejecta properties from the subsequent kilonova detection provided values of the ejecta mass from the merger. These values, when combined with the gravitational-wave measurement disfavors an equal-mass configuration, with the level of disagreement dependent on the assumed amount of ejecta mass of dynamical origin. Within the confines of our own galaxy, several binary neutron star systems along with measurements of their component masses have been made. If those distributions are indicative of a universal distribution, the joint measurement of the component masses of GW170817 represents an outlier. This tension is not easily resolvable from physical arguments, as the proposed pathways which form binary neutron stars do not often produce very asymmetrical pairs. Even accounting for the uncertainty associated with the total mass of the dynamical ejecta, this tension suggests that the distribution of binary neutron star masses in the galaxy is not indicative of those in other galaxies.

In this letter, we perform a 2-dimensional radiative transfer simulation for a kilonova/macronova consistently taking the interplay of multiple ejecta components into account. We show that the lightcurves and photospheric velocity of SSS17a can be reproduced naturally by a setup consistent with the prediction of the numerical-relativity simulations.

title: Constraining the Environmental Properties of FRB 131104 Using the Unified Dynamical Afterglow Model
authors: Zong-Kai Peng, Shan-Qin Wang, Liang-Duan Liu, Zi-Gao Dai, Hai Yu
topic:  In this paper, we adopt a unified afterglow model that takes into account the non-relativistic effect and jet effect and use the upper limits of four bands (5.5 GHz, 7.5 GHz, U-band, and X-ray) to obtain more stringent constraints on the parameter space spanned by \epsilon_B and n. We thus suggest that FRB 131104/Swift J0644.5-5111 might originate from a black hole-neutron star merger event. Moreover, we calculate multi-band emissions from a kilonova powered by the radioactivity of r-process elements synthesized in the ejected neutron-rich material and find that the U-band emission from the putative kilonova is significantly lower than the upper limit of the observations.

topic: We present late-time radio observations of GW170817, the first binary neutron star merger discovered through gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. Our observations, carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, were optimized to detect polarized radio emission, and thus to constrain the linear polarization fraction of GW170817. At an epoch of \sim 244 days after the merger, we rule out linearly polarized emission above a fraction of ~1\2 \% at a frequency of 2.8 GHz (99\% confidence). Within the structured jet scenario (a.k.a. successful jet plus cocoon system) for GW170817, the derived upper-limit on the radio continuum linear polarization fraction strongly constrains the magnetic field configuration in the shocked ejecta. We show that our results for GW170817 are compatible with the low level of linear polarization found in afterglows of cosmological long gamma-ray bursts. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of future expectations for the study of radio counterparts of binary neutron star mergers identified by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.

title: Evaluating radiation transport errors in merger simulations using a Monte-Carlo algorithm
authors: Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, Lawerence E. Kidder, Ronny Nguyen, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: Unfortunately, Boltzmann's equations of radiation transport remain too costly to be evolved directly in merger simulations. Simulations rely instead on approximate transport algorithms with unquantified modeling errors. In this paper, we use for the first time a time-dependent general relativistic Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm to solve Boltzmann's equations and estimate important properties of the neutrino distribution function \sim 10ms after a neutron star merger. We do not fully couple the MC algorithm to the fluid evolution, but use a short evolution of the merger remnant to critically assess errors in our approximate gray two-moment transport scheme. We demonstrate that the analytical closure used by the moment scheme is highly inaccurate in the polar regions, but performs well elsewhere. While the average energy of polar neutrinos is reasonably well captured by the two-moment scheme, estimates for the neutrino energy become less accurate at lower latitudes. The two-moment formalism also overestimates the density of neutrinos in the polar regions by \sim 50%, and underestimates the neutrino pair-annihilation rate at the poles by factors of 2-3. Although the latter is significantly more accurate than one might have expected before this study, our results indicate that predictions for the properties of polar outflows and for the creation of a baryon-free region at the poles are likely to be affected by errors in the two-moment scheme, thus limiting our ability to reliably model kilonovae and gamma-ray bursts.

We also put forward alternative strong (\sim G) magnetic field scenarios able to support this emission. For such stronger fields, the photo-disintegration of non-thermal nuclei within the source is considered, and a bottleneck period of \sim 5-30 days is found when this process peaks. We find that this class of source is in principle able to support the population of cosmic rays detected at Earth below the "ankle".

title: The progenitors of compact-object binaries: impact of metallicity, common envelope and natal kicks
authors: Nicola Giacobbo, Michela Mapelli
topic: We investigate the impact of progenitor's metallicity, of the common-envelope parameter α and of the natal kicks on the properties of DNSs, BHNSs and BHBs. We find that neutron-star (NS) masses in DNSs span from 1.1 to 2.0 Msun, with a preference for light NSs, while NSs in merging BHNSs have mostly large masses (1.3−2.0 Msun). BHs in merging BHNSs are preferentially low mass (5−15 Msun). BH masses in merging BHBs strongly depend on the progenitor's metallicity and span from \sim 5 to \sim 45 Msun. The local merger rate density of both BHNSs and BHBs derived from our simulations is consistent with the values reported by the LVC in all our simulations. In contrast, the local merger rate density of DNSs matches the value inferred from the LVC only if low natal kicks are assumed. This result adds another piece to the intricate puzzle of natal kicks and DNS formation.

We investigate the impact of ECSNe on the formation of DNSs by means of population synthesis simulations.

Finally, we have considered the extreme case in which all neutron stars receive a low natal kick. In this case, the number of DNSs increases by a factor of ten and the percentage of merging DNSs which went through an ECSN is significantly suppressed.

Using the final observation as a template, we uncover a source at the position of GW170817 at 4.5 micron with a brightness of 22.9+/-0.3 AB mag at 43 days and 23.8+/-0.3 AB mag at 74 days (the uncertainty is dominated by systematics from the image subtraction. The measured brightness is dimmer by a factor of about 2-3 times compared to our previously published kilonova model, which is based on UV, optical, and near-IR data at less 30 days. However, the observed fading rate and color are consistent with our model. We suggest that the discrepancy is likely due to a transition to the nebular phase, or a reduced thermalization efficiency at such late time. Using the Spitzer data as a guide, we briefly discuss the prospects of observing future binary neutron star mergers with Spitzer (in LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3) and the James Webb Space Telescope (in LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 4 and beyond).

We find that mass transfer from a stripped post-helium-burning secondary (case BB) onto a neutron star is most likely dynamically stable.

title: Particle acceleration in relativistic magnetic flux-merging events
authors: Maxim Lyutikov (Purdue), Serguei Komissarov (Leeds), Lorenzo Sironi (Columbia), Oliver Porth (Goethe-Universitat)
topic: Using analytical and numerical methods (fluid and particle-in-cell simulations) we study a number of model problems involving merger of magnetic flux tubes in relativistic magnetically-dominated plasma. Mergers of current-carrying flux tubes (exemplified by the two dimensional `ABC' structures) and zero total current magnetic flux tubes are considered.  We identify two stages of particle acceleration during flux mergers: (i) fast explosive prompt X-point collapse and (ii) ensuing island merger. The fastest acceleration occurs during the initial catastrophic X-point collapse, with the reconnection electric field of the order of the magnetic field. During the X-point collapse particles are accelerated by charge-starved electric fields, which can reach (and even exceed) values of the local magnetic field. The explosive stage of reconnection produces non-thermal power-law tails with slopes that depend on the average magnetization. The X-point collapse stage is followed by magnetic island merger that dissipates a large fraction of the initial magnetic energy in a regime of forced magnetic reconnection, further accelerating the particles, but proceeds at a slower reconnection rate.

title: Free Neutron Ejection From Shock Breakout in Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Ayako Ishii, Toshikazu Shigeyama, Masaomi Tanaka
topic: It is expected that some of such neutrons having avoided capturing positrons remain as free neutrons even after disappearance of electron-positron pairs. To investigate how many free neutrons can be ejected from merging neutron stars, we performed special-relativistic Lagrangian hydrodynamics computation with simplified models of this phenomenon in which a spherically symmetric shock wave propagates in the hydrostatic envelope and emerge from the surface. We systematically study a wide parameter space of the size of the merging neutron stars and the energy involved in the shock waves. As a result, it is found that the mass of remaining free neutron is \sim 10**-6 which is smaller than the previously expected by more than two orders of magnitude.  We briefly discuss the emission from the free neutron layer and estimate the luminosity in the optical band to be about

title: Fading of the X-ray Afterglow of Neutron Star Merger GW170817/GRB170817A at 260 days
authors: Melania Nynka, John J. Ruan, Daryl Haggard, Phil A. Evans
topic: We present new, deep Chandra observations of GW170817/GRB170817A at 260 days post-merger that reveal an X-ray flux and confirm that the X-ray light curve is now also fading. Through rigorous comparisons to previous Chandra observations of GW170817/GRB170817A, X-ray fading is detected between 160 and 260 days post-merger based on the X-ray data alone. We further constrain the X-ray photon index to steepen significance during this period, which disfavors the passing of the synchrotron cooling frequency through the X-ray band as the cause of the observed fading. These observations remain consistent with optically thin synchrotron afterglow emission. If this afterglow emission arises from a quasi-spherical mildly relativistic outflow, the X-ray fading suggests that the outflow is now decelerating. Alternatively, if this afterglow arises from a successful off-axis structured jet, the X-ray fading suggests that emission from the jet core has already entered the line of sight.

title: Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Afterglows with Two-Component Jets: Polarization Evolution Revisited
authors: Mi-Xiang Lan, Xue-Feng Wu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been widely argued to originate from binary compact object mergers or core collapses of massive stars. Jets from these systems may have two components, an inner, narrow sub-jet and an outer, wider sub-jet. Such a jet subsequently interacts with its ambient gas, leading to a reverse shock (RS) and a forward shock (FS). The magnetic field in the narrow sub-jet is very likely to be mixed by an ordered component and a random component during the afterglow phase. In this paper, we calculate light curves and polarization evolution of optical afterglows with this mixed magnetic field in the RS region of the narrow sub-jet in a two-component jet model. The resultant light curve has two peaks: an early peak arises from the narrow sub-jet and a late-time rebrightening is due to the wider sub-jet. We find the polarization degree (PD) evolution under such a mixed magnetic field confined in the shock plane is very similar to that under the purely ordered magnetic field condition

title: A Globular Cluster Luminosity Function Distance to NGC 4993 Hosting a Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817/GRB 170817A
authors: Myung Gyoon Lee, Jisu Kang, Myungshin Im
topic: NGC 4993 hosts a binary neutron star merger emitting gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves, GW170817/GRB 170817A. The distance to this galaxy is not well established. We select the globular cluster candidates from the Hubble Space Telescope/ACS F606W images of NGC 4993 in the archive, using the structural parameters of the detected sources.  Also the luminosity function of these candidates is fit well by a Gaussian function. We derive an extinction-corrected turnover Vega magnitude in the luminosity function of the globular clusters we derive a distance to NGC 4993, d = 41.65 plus minus 3.00 Mpc. The systematic error of this method can be as large as  0.3 mag. This value is consistent with the previous distance estimates based on the fundamental plane relation and the gravitational wave method in the literature. The distance in this study can be used to constrain the values of the parameters including the inclination angle of the binary system in the models of gravitational wave analysis.

Our simulations largely vindicate formulae for ejecta properties but do not find the expected dependence of disk mass on neutron star compaction. We track the early evolution of the accretion disk, largely driven by shocking and fallback inflow, and do find notable equation of state effects on the structure of this early-time, neutrino-bright disk.

title: Numerical simulations of the jet dynamics and synchrotron radiation of binary neutron star merger event GW170817/GRB170817A
authors: Xiaoyi Xie, Jonathan Zrake, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We present numerical simulations of energetic flows propagating through the debris cloud of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. Starting from the scale of the central engine, we use a moving-mesh hydrodynamics code to simulate the complete dynamical evolution of the produced relativistic jets. We compute synchrotron emission directly from the simulations and present multi-band light curves of the early (sub-day) through late (weeks to years) afterglow stages. Our work systematically compares two distinct models for the central engine, referred to as the narrow and wide engine scenario, which is associated with a successful structured jet and a quasi-isotropic explosion respectively. The rapidly declining signature may be detectable for future BNS mergers during the first minutes to day following the GW chirp. Furthermore, its non-detection for the GRB170817A event may disfavor the wide, quasi-isotropic explosion model.

topic: We use gravitational-wave observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 to explore the tidal deformabilities and radii of neutron stars. We perform Bayesian parameter estimation with the source location and distance informed by electromagnetic observations. We also assume that the two stars have the same equation of state; we demonstrate that for stars with masses comparable to the component masses of GW170817, this is effectively implemented by assuming that the stars' dimensionless tidal deformabilities are determined by the binary's mass ratio. Our results are the first measurement of tidal deformability with a physical constraint on the star's equation of state and place the first lower bounds on the deformability and areal radii of neutron stars using gravitational waves.

title: What Powered the Optical Transient AT2017gfo Associated with GW170817?
authors: Shao-Ze Li, Liang-Duan Liu, Yun-Wei Yu, Bing Zhang
topic: The groundbreaking discovery of the optical transient AT2017gfo associated with GW170817 opens a unique opportunity to study the physics of double neutron star (NS) mergers. We argue that the standard interpretation of AT2017gfo as being powered by radioactive decays of r-process elements faces the challenge of simultaneously accounting for the peak luminosity and peak time of the event, as it is not easy to achieve the required high mass, and especially the low opacity of the ejecta required to fit the data. We consider energy injection from two types of the merger products: (1) a post-merger black hole powered by fallback accretion; and (2) a long-lived NS remnant. In the latter case, both early- and late-emission components can be well interpreted as due to energy injection from a spinning-down NS, with the required mass and opacity of the ejecta components well consistent with known numerical simulation results. We suggest that there is a strong indication that the merger product of GW170817 is a long-lived (supramassive or even permanently stable), low magnetic field NS. The result provides a stringent constraint on the equations of state of NSs.

title: Measuring the viewing angle of GW170817 with electromagnetic and gravitational waves
authors: Daniel Finstad, Soumi De, Duncan A. Brown, Edo Berger, Christopher M. Biwer
topic: Here, we use joint GW-EM observations to measure the viewing angle of GW170817, the angle between the binary's angular momentum and the line of sight. We combine a direct measurement of the distance to the host galaxy of GW170817 (NGC 4993) of 40.7\pm2.36 Mpc with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)/Virgo GW data and find that the viewing angle is 32+10−13\pm1.7 degrees (90\% confidence, statistical, and systematic errors). We place a conservative lower limit on the viewing angle of more then 13\deg, which is robust to the choice of prior. This measurement provides a constraint on models of the prompt \gamma-ray and radio/X-ray afterglow emission associated with the merger; for example, it is consistent with the off-axis viewing angle inferred for a structured jet model.

title: Production of Mo and Ru isotopes in neutrino-driven winds: implications for solar abundances and presolar grains
authors: Julia Bliss, Almudena Arcones, Yong-Zhong Qian
topic: The origin of the so-called p-isotopes 92,94[Mo] and 96,98[Ru] in the solar system remains a mystery as several astrophysical scenarios fail to account for them. In addition, data on presolar silicon carbide grains of type X (SiC X) exhibit peculiar Mo patterns, especially for 95,97[Mo]. We examine production of Mo and Ru isotopes in neutrino-driven winds associated with core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) over a wide range of conditions. We find that proton-rich winds can make dominant contributions to the solar abundance of 98[Ru], significant contributions to those of 96[Ru] (less 40%) and 92Mo (less 27%), and relatively minor contributions to that of 94[Mo] (less 14%). In contrast, neutron-rich winds make negligible contributions to the solar abundances of 92,94[Mo] and cannot produce 96,98[Ru]. However, we show that some neutron-rich winds can account for the peculiar Mo patterns in SiC X grains. Our results can be generalized if conditions similar to those studied here are also obtained for other types of ejecta in either CCSNe or neutron star mergers.

title: Short gamma-ray burst central engines
authors: Riccardo Ciolfi
topic: Growing evidence connects the progenitor systems of the short-hard subclass of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to the merger of compact object binaries composed by two neutron stars (NSs) or by a NS and a black hole (BH). However, the mechanisms through which a BNS or NS-BH merger remnant would power a collimated outflow are much less constrained. Understanding the properties of the remnant systems and whether they can provide the right conditions for jet production has been a main driver of the great effort devoted to study BNS and NS-BH mergers, and still represents a real challenge from both the physical and the computational point of view. One fundamental open question concerns the nature of the central engine itself. Here we elaborate on this key aspect, considering three different scenarios to explain the SGRB phenomenology based on different hypotheses on the nature of the merger remnant. Then, we discuss the basic properties of GRB 170817A and how this event would fit within the different frameworks of the above scenarios, under the assumption that it was or was not a canonical SGRB.

topic: However, observations of metal-poor stars with highly-enhanced r-process elements have revealed abundance patterns suggesting that multiple sites may be involved. To address this issue, and to advance our understanding of the r-process, we have initiated an extensive search for bright (V lenss 13.5), very metal-poor ([Fe/H] less then 2) stars in the Milky Way halo exhibiting strongly-enhanced r-process signatures. This paper presents the first sample collected in the Southern Hemisphere, using the echelle spectrograph on du Pont 2.5m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Of those, 12 stars are strongly enhanced in heavy r-process elements (r-II), 42 stars show moderate enhancements of heavy r-process material (r-I), and 20 stars exhibit low abundances of the heavy r-process elements and higher abundances of the light r-process elements relative to the heavy ones (limited-r). This search is more successful at finding r-process-enhanced stars compared to previous searches, primarily due to a refined target selection procedure that focuses on red giants.

authors: G. Fiorella Burgio, Anthea F. Fantina
topic:  We review the current status of the EoS for compact objects, that have been studied with both ab-initio many-body approaches and phenomenological models. We limit ourselves to the description of EoSs with purely nucleonic degrees of freedom, disregarding the appearance of strange baryonic matter and/or quark matter. We compare the theoretical predictions with different data coming from both nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations. Combining the complementary information thus obtained greatly enriches our insights into the dense nuclear matter properties. Current challenges in the description of the EoS are also discussed, mainly focusing on the model dependence of the constraints extracted from either experimental or observational data (specifically, concerning the symmetry energy), the lack of a consistent and rigorous many-body treatment at zero and finite temperature of the matter encountered in compact stars (e.g. problem of cluster formation and extension of the EoS to very high temperatures), the role of nucleonic three-body forces, and the dependence of the direct URCA processes on the EoS.

title: The demographics of neutron star - white dwarf mergers: rates, delay-time distributions and progenitors
authors: S. Toonen, H.B. Perets, A.P. Igoshev, E. Michaely, Y. Zenati
topic: The mergers of neutron stars (NSs) and white dwarfs (WDs) could give rise to explosive transients, potentially observable with current and future transient surveys. However, the expected properties and distribution of such events is not well understood. Here we characterize the rates of such events, their delay time distribution, their progenitors and the distribution of their properties. We use binary populations synthesis models and consider a wide range of initial conditions and physical processes. We find that the majority of NS-WD mergers are born in systems in which mass-transfer played an important role, and the WD formed before the NS. For the majority of the mergers the WDs have a carbon-oxygen composition (60-80%) and most of the rest are with oxygen-neon WDs. The rates of NS-WD mergers are in the range of 3-15% of the type Ia supernovae (SNe) rate. Their delay time distribution is very similar to that of type Ia SNe, but slightly biased towards earlier times. They typically explode in young 0.1-1Gyr environments, but have a tail distribution extending to long, Gyrs-timescales.

title: Shock acceleration of electrons and synchrotron emission from the dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers
authors: Shiu-Hang Lee, Keiichi Maeda, Norita Kawanaka
topic: As analogous to supernovae and supernova remnants, the NSM dynamical ejecta are expected to produce non-thermal emission by electrons accelerated at a shock wave. In this paper, we present expected radio and X-ray signals by this mechanism, taking into account non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and magnetic field amplification. We suggest that the NSM has a unique nature as a DSA site, where the seed relativistic electrons are abundantly provided by the decays of r-process elements. The signal is predicted to peak at a few 100 - 1,000 days after the merger, determined by the balance between the decrease of the number of seed electrons and the increase of the dissipated kinetic energy due to the shock expansion. While the resulting flux can ideally reach to the maximum flux expected from near-equipartition, the available kinetic energy dissipation rate of the NSM ejecta limits the detectability of such a signal. It is likely that the radio and X-ray emission are overwhelmed by other mechanisms (e.g., an off-axis jet) for an observer placed to a jet direction (i.e., for GW170817). On the other hand, for an off-axis observer, to be discovered once a number of NSMs are identified, the dynamical ejecta component is predicted to dominate the non-thermal emission. While the detection of this signal is challenging even with near-future facilities, this potentially provides a robust probe of the creation of r-process elements in NSMs.

title: Long-lived Remnants from Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: David Radice, Albino Perego, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Bing Zhang
topic: We find that gravitational-wave (GW) emission is not able to remove this excess angular momentum within the time over which solid body rotation should be achieved. Instead, we argue that the excess angular momentum could be carried away by massive winds. Long-lived merger remnants are also formed with larger gravitational masses than those of rigidly-rotating NSs having the same number of baryons. The excess mass is likely radiated in the form of neutrinos. The evolution of long-lived remnants on the viscous timescale is thus determined by the interplay of finite-temperature effects, mass ejection, and neutrinos with potentially dramatic consequences for the remnants' properties and stability. We also provide an empirical fit for the spin of the remnant at the end of its viscous evolution as a function of its final mass, and we discuss the implications for the magnetar model of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Finally, we investigate the possible electromagnetic signatures associated with the viscous ejecta. Massive outflows possibly resulting from the formation of long-lived remnants would power unusually bright, blue kilonova counterparts to GW events and SGRBs whose detection would provide smoking gun evidence for the formation of long-lived remnants.

title: Central Engine-Powered Bright X-ray Flares in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts: A Hint of Black Hole-Neutron Star Merger?
authors: Hui-Jun Mu, Wei-Min Gu, Jirong Mao, Shu-Jin Hou, Da-Bin Lin, Tong Liu
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts may originate from the merger of double neutron stars (NS) or that of a black hole (BH) and an NS. We propose that the bright X-ray flare related to the central engine reactivity may hint a BH-NS merger, since such a merger can provide more fall-back materials and therefore a more massive accretion disk than the NS-NS merger. Based on the observed 49 short bursts with Swift/X-ray Telescope follow-up observations, we find that three bursts have bright X-ray flares, among which three flares from two bursts are probably related to the central engine reactivity. We argue that these two bursts may originate from the BH-NS merger rather than the NS-NS merger. Our suggested link between the central engine-powered bright X-ray flare and the BH-NS merger event can be checked by the future gravitational wave detections from advanced LIGO and Virgo.

title: Bimodal distribution of short gamma-ray bursts: evidence for two distinct types of short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Y. B. Yu, L. B. Li, B. Li, J. J. Geng, Y. F. Huang
topic: Recently, GRB 170817A was confirmed to be associated with GW 170817, which was produced by a neutron star - neutron star merger. It indicates that at least some short gamma-ray bursts come from binary neutron star mergers. Theoretically, it is widely accepted that short gamma-ray bursts can be produced by two distinctly different mechanisms, binary neutron star mergers and neutron star - black hole mergers. These two kinds of bursts should be different observationally due to their different trigger mechanisms. Motivated by this idea, we collect a universal data set constituted of 51 short gamma-ray bursts observed by Swift/BAT, among which 14 events have extended emission component. We study the observational features of these 51 events statistically. It is found that our samples are consisted of two distinct groups. They clearly show a bimodal distribution when their peak photon fluxes at 15-150 keV band are plotted against the corresponding fluences. Most interestingly, all the 14 short bursts with extended emission lie in a particular region

title: Electrical Resistivity and Hall Effect in Binary Neutron-Star Mergers
authors: Arus Harutyunyan, Antonios Nathanail, Luciano Rezzolla, Armen Sedrakian
topic: We examine the range of rest-mass densities, temperatures and magnetic fields involved in simulations of binary neutron-star mergers and identify the conditions under which the ideal-magnetohydrodynamics approximation breaks down and hence the magnetic-field decay should be accounted for. We use recent calculations of the conductivities of warm correlated plasma in envelopes of compact stars and find that the magnetic-field decay timescales are much larger than the characteristic timescales of the merger process for lengthscales down to a meter. Because these are smaller than the currently available resolution in numerical simulations, the ideal-magnetohydrodynamics approximation is effectively valid for all realistic simulations. At the same time, we find that the Hall effect can be important at low densities and low temperatures, where it can induce a non-dissipative rearrangement of the magnetic field. Finally, we mark the region in temperature and density where the hydrodynamic description breaks down.

authors: Tim Dietrich, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Bernd Bruegmann, Wolfgang Tichy
topic: Numerical relativity simulations are the only tool to describe the binary's merger dynamics in the regime when speeds are largest and gravity is strongest. In this work we report state-of-the-art binary neutron star simulations for irrotational (non-spinning) and spinning configurations. The main use of these simulations is to model the gravitational-wave signal. Key numerical requirements are the understanding of the convergence properties of the numerical data and a detailed error budget. The simulations have been performed on different HPC clusters, they use multiple grid resolutions, and are based on eccentricity reduced quasi-circular initial data. We obtain convergent waveforms with phase errors of 0.5-1.5 rad accumulated over approximately 12 orbits to merger. The waveforms have been used for the construction of a phenomenological waveform model which has been applied for the analysis of the recent binary neutron star detection. Additionally, we show that the data can also be used to test other state-of-the-art semi-analytical waveform models.

title: Gamma Ray Bursts. Progenitors, accretion in the central engine, jet acceleration mechanisms
authors: Agnieszka Janiuk, Kostas Sapountzis 
topic: The collapsar model was proposed to explain the long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), while the short GRBs are associated with the mergers of compact objects. In the first case, mainly the energetics of the events is consistent with the proposed progenitor models, while the duration, time variability, as well as the afterglow emission may shed some light on the detailed properties of the collapsing massive stars.  For long ones, the rotation of the progenitor star is a key property in order to support accretion over relatively long activity periods, and also to sustain the rotation of the black hole itself. The latter is responsible for ejection of the relativistic jets, which are powered due to the extraction of the BH rotational energy, mitigated by the accretion torus and magnetic fields. The jets must break through the stellar envelope though, which poses a question on the efficiency of this process. Similar mechanisms of powering the jet ejection may act in short GRBs, which in this case may freely propagate through the interstellar medium. The power of the jets launched from the rotating black hole is at first associated mostly with the magnetic Poynting flux, and then at large distances it is transferred to the kinetic and finally radiative energy of the expanding shells.

title: Tidal deformability from GW170817 as a direct probe of the neutron star radius
authors: Carolyn Raithel, Feryal Özel, Dimitrios Psaltis
topic: We report here on a new simplification that arises in the effective tidal deformability of the binary, when the chirp mass is specified. We find that, in this case, the effective tidal deformability of the binary is surprisingly independent of the component masses of the individual neutron stars, and instead depends primarily on the ratio of the chirp mass to the neutron star radius. Thus, a measurement of the effective tidal deformability can be used to directly measure the neutron star radius. We find that the upper limit on the effective tidal deformability from GW170817 implies that the radius cannot be larger than \sim 13km, at the 90\% level, independent of the assumed masses for the component stars. The result can be applied generally, to probe the stellar radii in any neutron star-neutron star merger with a measured chirp mass

title: From gamma to Radio - The Electromagnetic Counterpart of GW 170817
authors: Ehud Nakar, Ore Gottlieb, Tsvi Piran, Mansi M. Kasliwal, Greg Hallinan 
topic: However, a closer examination of the sub-luminous γ-rays and the peculiar radio afterglow were inconsistent with this simple interpretation. Here we present results of 3D and 2D numerical simulations that follow the hydrodynamics and emission of the outflow from a neutron star merger form its ejection and up to its deceleration by the circum-merger medium. Our results show that the entire set of \gamma -rays, X-rays and radio observations can be explained by the emission from a mildly relativistic cocoon material (Lorentz factor \sim 2-5) that was formed while a jet propagated through the material ejected during the merger. The γ-rays are generated when the cocoon breaks out from the engulfing ejecta while the afterglow is produced by interaction of the cocoon matter with the interstellar medium. The strong early uv/optical signal may be a Lorentz boosted macronova/kilonova. The fate of the jet itself is currently unknown, but our full-EM models define a path to resolving between successful and choked jet scenarios, outputting coupled predictions for the image size, morphology, observed time-dependent polarization and light curve behavior from radio to X-ray. The predictive power of these models will prove key in interpreting the on-going multi-faceted observations of this unprecedented event.

title: Brightening X-ray/Optical/Radio Emission of GW170817/SGRB 170817A: Results of an Electron-Positron Wind from the Central Engine?
authors: Jin-Jun Geng, Zi-Gao Dai, Yong-Feng Huang, Xue-Feng Wu, Long-Biao Li, Bing Li, Yan-Zhi Meng
topic: Recent follow-up observations of the binary neutron star (NS) merging event GW170817/SGRB 170817A reveal that its X-ray/optical/radio emissions are brightening continuously up to \sim 100 days post-merger. This late-time brightening is unexpected from the kilonova model or the off-axis top-hat jet model for gamma-ray burst afterglows. In this paper, by assuming that the merger remnant is a long-lived NS, we propose that the interaction between an electron-positron-pair (e+e−) wind from the central NS and the jet could produce a long-lived reverse shock, from which a new emission component would rise and can interpret current observations well. We suggest that radio polarization observations of the brightening would help to distinguish our scenario from other scenarios. Future observations on a large sample of short gamma-ray burst afterglows or detections of GW signals from merger remnants would test our scenario.

authors: Dougal Dobie, David L. Kaplan, Tara Murphy, Emil Lenc, Kunal P. Mooley, Christene Lynch, Alessandra Corsi, Dale Frail, Mansi Kasliwal, Gregg Hallinan
topic: We present 2-9 GHz radio observations of GW170817 covering the period 125-200 days post-merger, taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Our observations demonstrate that the radio afterglow peaked at 149±2 days post-merger and is now declining in flux density. We see no evidence for evolution in the radio-only spectral index, which remains consistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission connecting the radio, optical, and X-ray regimes. The peak implies a total energy in the synchrotron-emitting component of a few 10^50 ergs . The temporal decay rate is most consistent with mildly- or non-relativistic material and we do not see evidence for a very energetic off-axis jet, but we cannot distinguish between a lower-energy jet and more isotropic emission.

title: Xiao-Feng Cao, Yun-Wei Yu, Xia Zhou
authors: 
topic: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are usually suggested to be associated with mergers of compact binaries consisting of white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs), or black holes (BHs). We test these models by fitting the observational distributions in both redshift and isotropic energy of 22 Parkes FRBs, where, as usual, the rates of compact binary mergers (CBMs) are connected with cosmic star formation rates by a power-law distributed time delay. It is found that the observational distributions can well be produced by the CBM model with a characteristic delay time from several ten to several hundred Myr and an energy function index gamma 1.2 - 1.7 where a tentative fixed spectral index beta 0.8 is adopted for all FRBs.  This event rate, about an order of magnitude higher than the rates of NS-NS/NS-BH mergers, indicates that the most promising origin of FRBs in the CBM scenario could be mergers of WD-WD binaries. Here a massive WD could be produced since no FRB was found to be associated with a type Ia supernova. Alternatively, if actually all FRBs can repeat on a timescale much longer than the period of current observations, then they could also originate from a young active NS that forms from relatively rare NS-NS mergers and accretion-induced collapses of WD-WD binaries.

title: Off-axis afterglow light curves and images from 2D hydrodynamic simulations of double-sided GRB jets in a stratified external medium
authors: Jonathan Granot, Fabio De Colle, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
topic: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets are narrow, and thus typically point away from us. They are initially ultra-relativistic, causing their prompt γ-ray and early afterglow emission to be beamed away from us. However, as the jet gradually decelerates its beaming cone widens and eventually reaches our line of sight and the afterglow emission may be detected. Such orphan afterglows were not clearly detected so far. Nevertheless, they should be detected in upcoming optical or radio surveys, and it would be challenging to clearly distinguish between them and other types of transients. Therefore, we perform detailed, realistic calculations of the expected afterglow emission from GRB jets viewed at different angles from the jet's symmetry axis. The dynamics are calculated using 2D relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of jets propagating into different power-law external density profiles. ranging from a uniform ISM-like medium . to a stratified steady stellar-wind like profile k =2.  We calculate radio, optical and X-ray lightcurves, and the evolution of the radio afterglow image size, shape and flux centroid. This may help identify misaligned relativistic jets, whether initially ultra-relativistic and producing a GRB for observers within their beam, or (possibly intrinsically more common) moderately relativistic, in either (i) nearby supernovae Ib/c (some of which are associated with long duration GRBs), or (ii) in binary neutron star mergers, which may produce short duration GRBs, and may also be detected in gravitational waves (e.g. GW170827/GRB170817A with a weak prompt γ-ray emission may harbor an off-axis jet).

title: Light curves of a shock-breakout material and a relativistic off-axis jet from a Binary Neutron Star system
authors: N. Fraija, A.C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira, P. Veres
topic: Binary neutron star mergers are believed to eject significant masses with a diverse range of velocities. Once these ejected materials begin to be decelerated by a homogeneous medium, relativistic electrons are mainly cooled down by synchrotron radiation, generating a multiwavelength long-lived afterglow. Analytic and numerical methods illustrate that the outermost matter, the merger shock-breakout material, can be parametrized by power-law velocity distributions [func]. Considering that the shock-breakout material is moving on-axis towards the observer and the relativistic jet off-axis, we compute the light curves during the relativistic and the lateral expansion phase. As a particular case, we successfully describe the X-ray, optical and radio light curves alongside the spectral energy distribution from the recently discovered gravitational-wave transient GW170817, when the merger shock-breakout material moves with mildly relativistic velocities near-Newtonian phase and the jet with relativistic velocities. Future electromagnetic counterpart observations of this binary system could be able to evaluate different properties of these light curves.

title: Synchrotron radiation from the fast tail of dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers
authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Kenta Kiuchi, Masaru Shibata, Ehud Nakar, Tsvi Piran 
topic: We find, using high resolution numerical relativistic simulations, that the tail of the dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers extends to mildly relativistic velocities faster than 0.7c. The kinetic energy of this fast tail is depending on the neutron star equation of state and on the binary masses. The synchrotron flare arising from the interaction of this fast tail with the surrounding ISM can power the observed non-thermal emission that followed GW170817, provided that the ISM density 10^-2 the two neutron stars had roughly equal masses and the neutron star equation of state is soft (small neutron star radii). One of the generic predictions of this scenario is that the cooling frequency crosses the X-ray band on a time scale of a few months to a year, leading to a cooling break in the X-ray light curve. If this dynamical ejecta scenario is correct, we expect that the synchrotron radio flare from the ejecta that have produced the macronova/kilonova emission will be observable on time scales of 10^3 10^5 days

title: Continued Brightening of the Afterglow of GW170817/GRB 170817A as due to a Delayed Energy Injection
authors: Bing Li, Long-Biao Li, Yong-Feng Huang, Jin-Jun Geng, Yong-Bo Yu, Li-Ming Song
topic: The brightness of the multi-wavelength afterglow of GRB 170817A is increasing unexpectedly even approx 160 days after the associated gravitational burst. Here we suggest that the brightening can be caused by a late-time energy injection process. We use an empirical expression to mimic the evolution of the injection luminosity, which is consisted of a power-law rising phase and a power-law decreasing phase. It is found that the power-law indices of the two phases are 0.92 and −2.8, respectively, with the peak time of the injection being approx 110 days. The energy injection could be due to some kind of accretion, with the total accreted mass being \approx 0.006Msun. However, normal fall-back accretion, which usually lasts for a much shorter period, cannot provide a natural explanation. we argue that there should also be some ejecta with correspondingly lower velocities during the coalescence of the double neutron star system. They are bound by the gravitational well of the remnant central compact object and might be accreted at a timescale of about 100 days, providing a reasonable explanation for the energy injection. Detailed studies on the long-lasting brightening of GRB 170817A thus may provide useful information on the matter ejection during the merger process of binary neutron stars.

topic: (NS-NS) merger. In order to probe this association we confront our current understanding of the gravitational waves and associated electromagnetic radiation with four observed GRBs originating in binaries composed of different combinations NSs and white dwarfs (WDs). We consider 1) GRB 090510 the prototype of NS-NS merger leading to a black hole (BH); 2) GRB 130603B the prototype of a NS-NS merger leading to massive NS (MNS) with an associated kilonova; 3) GRB 060614 the prototype of a NS-WD merger leading to a MNS with an associated kilonova candidate; 4) GRB 170817A the prototype of a WD-WD merger leading to massive WD with an associated AT 2017gfo-like emission. None of these systems support the above mentioned association. The clear association between GRB 170817A and AT 2017gfo has led to introduce a new model based on on a new subfamily of GRBs originating from WD-WD mergers.

title: Effects of Fall-Back Accretion on Proto-Magnetar Outflows in Gamma-Ray Bursts and Superluminous Supernovae
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Paz Beniamini, Dimitrios Giannios
topic: Rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars ("millisecond proto-magnetars") are candidate central engines of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRB), superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), and binary neutron star mergers. The more complex evolution of the jet power and magnetization of an accreting magnetar more readily accounts for the high 56Ni yields GRB SNe and irregular time evolution of some GRB light curves (e.g.~bursts with precursors followed by a long quiescent interval before the main emission episode). Additional baryon-loading from accretion-powered neutrino irradiation of the magnetar polar cap lengthens the timeframe over which the jet magnetization is in the requisite range sigma less of equal 1e3 for efficient gamma-ray emission, thereby accommodating GRBs with ultra-long durations.

title: Is the macronova in GW170817 powered by the central engine?
authors: Tatsuya Matsumoto, Kunihito Ioka, Shota Kisaka, Ehud Nakar
topic:  Although the radioactivity of synthesized r-process elements is widely discussed as an energy source, its decisive evidence is not clearly shown yet. We discuss a macronova powered by the central engine activities such as jet activities and X-rays from the matter fallback, and show that the engine model allows much broader parameter spaces, in particular smaller ejecta mass 1e-4-0.01Msun than the r-process model. The blue and red macronovae are naturally explained by various combinations of the ejecta such as a cocoon and merger ejecta with the energy sources of jets and X-rays. The required energy injection is very similar to the X-ray excess observed in GRB 130603B with the power-law slope of \sim 1.3 The required lanthanoid fraction for the opacity can be also consistent with the Galactic one

topic: It has recently become clear that in both short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) it coexists a sequence of different events, each characterized by specific physical processes and corresponding values of the Lorentz gamma factors. The ultra-relativistic prompt emission (UPE) phase, with Lorentz factor less Gamma=1e4 is followed by a mildly relativistic plateau-afterglow phase with Gamma=2 The GeV radiation, with Gamma approx 50  coexists with the above two phases. It is shown that: a) the GeV radiation originates at the onset of the formation of a black hole (BH), b) its luminosity follows specific power-law dependence when measured in the rest frame of the source with a decay index gamma = -1.29 \mp 0.06. We present these conceptual results for the case of short GRBs in this article and give the extended analysis for long GRBs in a companion article. A direct astrophysical application of these results is that the merger of binary neutron stars leading to BH formation emits GeV radiation: the GeV emission is a necessary and sufficient condition to indicate the creation of a BH in S-GRBs.

Internal shocks give the most natural account of the observed peak energy, viewing angle and total energy. We also show that a simple external shock model can reproduce the observed GRB pulse with parameters consistent with those derived from the afterglow modeling. We find a simple cocoon shock breakout model is in mild tension with the observed spectral evolution, however it cannot be excluded based on gamma-ray data alone. Future joint observations of brighter GRBs will pose even tighter constraints on prompt emission models.

title: From actinides to zinc: Using the full abundance pattern of the brightest star in Reticulum II to distinguish between different r-process sites
authors: Alexander P. Ji, Anna Frebel
topic: The observed neutron-capture element abundances closely match the solar r-process component, except for the first r-process peak which is significantly lower than solar but matches other r-process enhanced stars. The ratio of first peak to heavier r-process elements implies the r-process site produces roughly equal masses of high and low electron fraction ejecta, within a factor of 2. We compare the detailed abundance pattern to predictions from nucleosynthesis calculations of neutron star mergers and magneto-rotationally driven jet supernovae, finding that nuclear physics uncertainties dominate over astrophysical uncertainties. The abundance of light elements up to Zn are consistent with extremely metal-poor Milky Way halo stars. They may eventually provide a way to distinguish between neutron star mergers and magneto-rotationally driven jet supernovae, but this would require more detailed knowledge of the chemical evolution of Reticulum II.

We find a region of the chart of nuclides where the probability of \beta-delayed fission is \approx 100%, that likely prevents the production of superheavy elements in nature. We explore the impact of \beta-delayed fission in rapid neutron capture process (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the tidal ejecta of a neutron star--neutron star merger and show that it is a key fission channel that shapes the final abundances near the second r-process peak.

authors: Roberto De Pietri, Alessandra Feo, José A. Font, Frank Löffler, Francesco Maione, Michele Pasquali, Nikolaos Stergioulas
topic: We present the first very long-term simulations (extending up to ~140 ms after merger) of binary neutron star mergers with piecewise polytropic equations of state and in full general relativity. Our simulations reveal that at a time of 30-50 ms after merger, parts of the star become convectively unstable, which triggers the excitation of inertial modes. The excited inertial modes are sustained up to several tens of milliseconds and are potentially observable by the planned third-generation gravitational-wave detectors at frequencies of a few kilohertz. Since inertial modes depend on the rotation rate of the star and they are triggered by a convective instability in the postmerger remnant, their detection in gravitational waves will provide a unique opportunity to probe the rotational and thermal state of the merger remnant. In addition, our findings have implications for the long-term evolution and stability of binary neutron star remnants

topic: Short gamma ray bursts are presumably results of binary neutron star mergers, which lead to the formation of a stellar mass black hole, surrounded by a remnant matter. The strong magnetic fields help collimate jets of plasma, launched along the axis of the black hole rotation. We study the structure and evolution of the accreting plasma in the short GRBs and we model the formation of the base of a relativistic, Poynting-dominated jets. Our numerical models are based on the general relativistic MHD, axisymmetric simulations. We discuss the origin of variability in the GRB jet emission, which timescales are related to the action of the magneto-rotational instability in the accreting plasma. We also estimate the value of a maximum achievable Lorentz factor in the jets produced by our simulations, and reached at the large distances, where the gamma ray emission is produced.

authors: Iair Arcavi
topic: The combined optical data show an early rise consistent with radioactive decay of low opacity ejecta as the main emission source, but the subsequent decline is fit well by all models. A lack of constraints on the ultraviolet flux during the first few hours after discovery allows for both radioactive decay and other cooling mechanisms to explain the early bolometric light curve. This analysis demonstrates that early (few hours after merger) high-cadence optical and ultraviolet observations will be critical for determining the source of blue emission in future kilonovae.

title: Inverse compton scattered merger-nova: late X-ray counterpart of gravitational wave signals from NS-NS/BH mergers
authors: Shunke Ai, He Gao
topic:  The central remnant could launch a collimated jet and when the jet propagating through the ejecta, a mildly relativistic cocoon would be formed and the interaction between the cocoon and the ambient medium would accelerate electrons via external shock in a wide angle. So that the merger-nova photons (i.e., thermal emission from the ejecta) would be scattered into higher frequency via inverse compton (IC) process when they propagating through the cocoon shocked region. We find that the IC scattered component peaks at X-ray band and it will reach its peak luminosity in order of days (simultaneously with the merger-nova emission). With current X-ray detectors, such a late X-ray component could be detected out to 200 Mpc, depending on the merger remnant properties. It could serve as an important electromagnetic counterpart of gravitational wave signals from NS-NS/BH mergers.

There is no clear evidence to support or rule out a long-lived NS as the merger remnant. Here we utilize the GW and electromagnetic (EM) signals to comprehensively investigate the parameter space that allows a long-lived NS to survive as the merger remnant of GW170817. We find that for some stiff equations of state, the merger of GW170817 could, in principle, lead to a massive NS, which has a millisecond spin period. The post-merger GW signal could hardly constrain the ellipticity of the NS

title: Compton echoes from nearby Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Paz Beniamini, Dimitrios Giannios, George Younes, Alexander J. van der Horst, Chryssa Kouveliotou
topic: We consider here Compton echoes, the scattered light from the prompt and afterglow emission. Compton echoes, an as yet undetected counterpart of GRBs, peak in X-rays and maintain a roughly constant flux for hundreds to thousands of years after the burst. Though too faint to be detected in typical cosmological GRBs, a fraction of close by bursts with a sufficiently large energy output in X-rays, and for which the surrounding medium is sufficiently dense, may indeed be observed in this way. The detection of a Compton echo could provide unique insight into the burst properties and the environment's density structure. In particular, it could potentially determine whether or not there was a successful jet that broke through the compact binary merger ejecta. We discuss here the properties and expectations from Compton echoes and suggest methods for detectability.

topic: Outflows launched from a remnant disc of compact binary merger may have essential contribution to the kilonova emission. Numerical calculations are conducted in this work to study the structure of accretion flows and outflows. By the incorporation of limited-energy advection in the hyper-accretion discs, outflows occur naturally from accretion flows due to imbalance between the viscous heating and the sum of the advective and radiative cooling. Following this spirit, we revisit the properties of the merger outflow ejecta. Our results show that around of the disc mass can be launched as powerful outflows. The amount of unbound mass varies with the disc mass and the viscosity. The outflow-contributed peak luminosity is around.

title: Implications of the radio and X-ray emission that followed GW170817
authors: Ehud Nakar, Tsvi Piran
topic: The radio and X-rays that followed GW170817 increased gradually over similar  100 days, resembling the radio flare predicted to arise from the interaction of a binary neutron star merger outflow with the ISM \citep{nakar2011}. Considering a blast wave moving with a Lorentz factor Gamma, we show that an off-axis observer, namely an observer at. Observations imply that at all times we have seen an on-axis emission. The isotropic equivalent energy in the observed region increases with time,  implying that the outflow was structured. The energy increase can arise from a slower material moving behind the blast wave or from a matter moving at larger angles that has slowed down. Such a structure could have different origins, however, the only physically motivated one, proposed so far, is the interaction of a relativistic jet with the ejecta and the resulting cocoon. The jet could have been choked or successful. In the latter case, it has produced a short GRB pointing elsewhere (this successful jet-cocoon system is sometimes called a "structured jet")

topic: A high-resolution spectroscopic analysis is presented for a new highly r-process-enhanced very metal-poor retrograde halo star, RAVE J153830.9-180424, discovered as part of the R-Process Alliance survey. J1538-1804's r-process pattern matches that of the Sun for elements between the first, second, and third peaks, and does not exhibit an actinide boost. Cosmo-chronometric age-dating reveals the r-process material to be quite old. This robust main r-process pattern is a necessary constraint for r-process formation scenarios (of particular interest in light of the recent neutron star merger, GW 170817), and has important consequences for the origins of r-II stars. Additional r-I and r-II stars will be reported by the R-Process Alliance in the near future.

title: Uncertainties in radiative neutron-capture rates relevant to the A similar 80 r-process peak
authors: I. K. B. Kullmann, E. W. Hafli, A.C. Larsen, E. Lima
topic: The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) has for the first time been confirmed to take place in a neutron-star merger event. A detailed understanding of the rapid neutron-capture process is one of the holy grails in nuclear astrophysics. In this work we investigate one aspect of the r-process modelling: uncertainties in radiative neutron-capture cross sections and astrophysical reaction rates for isotopes of the elements Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, and Se. In particular, we study deviations from standard libraries used for astrophysics, and the influence of a very-low γ-energy enhancement in the average, reduced γ-decay probability on the (n,γ) rates. We find that the intrinsic uncertainties are in some cases extremely large, and that the low-energy enhancement, if present in neutron-rich nuclei, may increase the neutron-capture reaction rate significantly.

authors: E. Troja, L. Piro, G. Ryan, H. van Eerten, R. Ricci, M. H. Wieringa, S. Lotti, T. Sakamoto, S. B. Cenko
topic: We present our broadband study of GW170817 from radio to hard X-rays, including NuSTAR and Chandra observations up to 165 days after the merger, and a multi-messenger analysis including LIGO constraints. The data are compared with predictions from a wide range of models, providing the first detailed comparison between non-trivial cocoon and jet models. Homogeneous and power-law shaped jets, as well as simple cocoon models are ruled out by the data, while both a Gaussian shaped jet and a cocoon with energy injection can describe the current dataset for a reasonable range of physical parameters, consistent with the typical values derived from short GRB afterglows. We propose that these models can be unambiguously discriminated by future observations measuring the post-peak behaviour, with slope -1.0 for the cocoon and -2.5 for the jet model.

topic: We report our observation of the short GRB 170817A, associated to the binary neutron star merger event GW 170817, perfomed in the X-ray band with XMM-Newton 135 d after the event (on the 29th December 2017). We find evidence for a flattening of the X-ray light curve with respect to the previously observed brightening. We interpret all the existing afterglow data with two models: i) a structured jet and ii) a jet-less isotropic fireball with some stratification in its radial velocity structure. Both models fit the data and predict that the radio flux must decrease simultaneously with the optical and the X-ray one, making hard to distinguish between them at the present stage. Polarimetric measures and the rate of short GRB-GW association in future LIGO/Virgo runs will be key to disentangle these two geometrically different scenarios.

title: Prompt gamma-ray emission of GRB 170817A associated to GW 170817: A consistent picture
authors: Houri Ziaeepour
topic: Here we use a phenomenological model of shock evolution and synchrotron/self-Compton emission to simulate the prompt emission of GRB 170817A and to test above proposals. We find that synchrotron emission from a mildly relativistic cocoon with a Lorentz factor of 2-3, as considered in the literature, generates a too soft, too long, and too bright prompt emission. Off-axis view of an structured jet with a Lorentz factor of about 10 can reproduce observations, but needs a very efficient transfer of kinetic energy to electrons in internal shocks, which is disfavored by particle in cell simulations. We also comment on cocoon breakout as a mechanism for generation of the prompt gamma-ray. A relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of about 100 and a density lower than typical short GRBs seems to be the most plausible model and we conclude that GRB 170817A was intrinsically faint. Based on this result and findings of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BNS merger in the literature we discuss physical and astronomical conditions, which may lead to such faint short GRBs

title: An explosion is triggered by the late collapse of the compact remnant from a neutron star merger
authors: Antonios Nathanail
topic: The collapse of this compact remnant to a black- hole-torus system is expected to give rise to a powerful jet and a short gamma-ray burst. Nevertheless, if the collapse is delayed half a second or so, the surrounding matter would be already accreted and/or expelled and hence no torus will be formed. However, the collapse itself will give rise to a quasi-isotropic magnetized fireball. This magnetic bomb will dissipate much of its energy due to magnetic re-connection and will produce the prompt emission, when the fireball will become transparent to gamma-rays. The energy range of such an explosion depends on the initial magnetic field strength of the two neutron stars and the amplification of the magnetic energy during merger. We discuss the production of a quasi-isotropic magnetized fireball and its subsequent interaction with the ejected matter during merger, as the outcome of the coalescence of a binary neutron star system.

topic: Short GRBs are also expected to emit very-high energy (VHE, > 100 GeV) photons and VHE electromagnetic (EM) upper limits have been set with observations performed by ground-based gamma-ray detectors and during the intense EM follow-up campaign associated with GW170817/GRB 170817A. In the next years, the searches for VHE EM counterparts will become more effective thanks to the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) We present a comprehensive study on the prospects for joint GW and VHE EM observations of merging BNSs with Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and CTA, based on detailed simulations of the multi-messenger emission and detection. We propose a new observational strategy optimized on the prior assumptions about the EM emission.

title: A magnetar origin for the kilonova ejecta in GW170817
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Todd A. Thompson, Eliot Quataert
topic: We propose an alternative ejecta source: the neutrino-heated, magnetically-accelerated wind from the strongly-magnetized hypermassive NS (HMNS) remnant. A rapidly-spinning HMNS with an ordered surface magnetic field of strength B ~ 1-3e14 G and lifetime t_rem ~ 0.1-1 s can simultaneously explain the velocity, total mass, and electron fraction of the blue KN ejecta. The inferred HMNS lifetime is close to its Alfven crossing time, suggesting global magnetic torques could be responsible for bringing the HMNS into solid body rotation and instigating its gravitational collapse. Different origins for the KN ejecta may be distinguished by their predictions for the emission in the first hours after the merger, when the luminosity is enhanced by heating from internal shocks; the latter are likely generic to any temporally-extended ejecta source (e.g. magnetar or accretion disk wind) and are not unique to the emergence of a relativistic jet.

authors: Raffaella Margutti, K.D. Alexander, X. Xie, L. Sironi, B.D. Metzger, A. Kathirgamaraju, W. Fong, P.K. Blanchard, E. Berger, A. MacFadyen, et al
topic: We report deep Chandra, HST and VLA observations of the binary neutron star event GW170817 at t less 160 d after merger. These observations show that GW170817 has been steadily brightening with time and might have now reached its peak, and constrain the emission process as non-thermal synchrotron emission where the cooling frequency νc is above the X-ray band and the synchrotron frequency nu_m is below the radio band. The very simple power-law spectrum extending for eight orders of magnitude in frequency enables the most precise measurement of the index p of the distribution of non-thermal relativistic electrons N(gamma)\prop to gamma−p accelerated by a shock launched by a NS-NS merger to date.  We find p=2.17 \pm 0.01, which indicates that radiation from ejecta with Gamma similar 3−10 dominates the observed emission. While constraining the nature of the emission process, these observations do \emph{not} constrain the nature of the relativistic ejecta. We employ simulations of explosive outflows launched in NS ejecta clouds to show that the spectral and temporal evolution of the non-thermal emission from GW170817 is consistent with both emission from radially stratified quasi-spherical ejecta traveling at mildly relativistic speeds, \emph{and} emission from off-axis collimated ejecta characterized by a narrow cone of ultra-relativistic material with slower wings extending to larger angles. In the latter scenario, GW170817 harbored a normal SGRB directed away from our line of sight.

topic: Surface abundance observations of halo stars hint at the occurrence of r-process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity... Possible loci of early-Universe r-process nucleosynthesis are the ejecta of either black hole--neutron star or neutron star--neutron star binary mergers. Here we study the effect of the inclination--eccentricity oscillations raised by a tertiary (e.g. a star) on the coalescence time scale of the inner compact object binaries. Our results are highly sensitive to the assumed initial distribution of the inner binary semi-major axes. Our results provide additional support to the compact object merger scenario for r-process nucleosynthesis.

topic: The electromagnetic signal began approximately 2 seconds post-merger with a weak, short burst of gamma-rays, which was followed over the next hours and days by the ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared emission from a radioactively- powered kilonova. Later, non-thermal rising X-ray and radio emission was observed. The low luminosity of the gamma-rays and the rising non-thermal flux from the source at late times could indicate that we are outside the opening angle of the beamed relativistic jet. Alternatively, the emission could be arising from a cocoon of material formed from the interaction between a jet and the merger ejecta. Here we present late-time optical detections and deep near-infrared limits on the emission from GW170817 at 110 days post-merger. Our new observations are at odds with expectations of late-time emission from kilonova models, being too bright and blue. Instead, the emission arises from the interaction between the relativistic ejecta of GW170817 and the interstellar medium. We show that this emission matches the expectations of a Gaussian structured relativistic jet, which would have launched a high luminosity short GRB to an aligned observer. However, other jet structure or cocoon models can also match current data - the future evolution of the afterglow will directly distinguish the origin of the emission.

title: Optimized Radio Follow Up of Binary Neutron-Star Mergers
authors: Dario Carbone, Alessandra Corsi
topic: We simulate GW170817-like radio transients, and radio afterglows generated by fast jets with isotropic energy expanding in a low-density interstellar medium bserved from different viewing angles (from slightly off-axis to largely off-axis). We then determine the optimal timing of GHz radio observations following the precise localization of the BNS radio counterpart candidate, assuming a sensitivity comparable to that of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The optimization is done so as to ensure that properties such as viewing angle and circumstellar density can be correctly reconstructed with the minimum number of observations. We show that radio is the optimal band to explore the fastest ejecta from BNSs in low-density ISM, since the optical emission is likelyto be dominated by the so-called `kilonova' component, while X-rays from the jet are detectable only for a small subset of the BNS models considered here.

title: The Origin of the Prompt Emission for Short GRB 170817A: Photosphere Emission or Synchrotron Emission?
authors: Yan-Zhi Meng, Jin-Jun Geng, Bin-Bin Zhang, Jun-Jie Wei et al
topic: The origin of this short GRB is still under debate, but a plausible interpretation is that it is due to the off-axis emission from a structured jet. We consider two possibilities. First, since the best-fit spectral model for the main pulse of GRB 170817A is a cutoff power law with a hard low-energy photon index (α=−0.62+0.49−0.54), we consider an off-axis photosphere model. We develop a theory of photosphere emission in a structured jet and find that such a model can reproduce a low-energy photon index that is softer than a blackbody through enhancing high-latitude emission. The model can naturally account for the observed spectrum. The best-fit Lorentz factor along the line of sight is \sim 20, which demands that there is a significant delay between the merger and jet launching. Alternatively, we consider that the emission is produced via synchrotron radiation in an optically thin region in an expanding jet with decreasing magnetic fields.

title: Neutron Star Mergers as sites of r-process Nucleosynthesis and Short Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Paz Beniamini, Tsvi Piran
topic: We overview observational evidence supporting this scenario including: the total amount of r-process elements in the Galaxy, extreme metal poor stars, geological radioactive elemental abundances, dwarf galaxies, and short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). The ultra-violet, optical, and near infrared observations point to r-process elements that have been synthesized in the merger ejecta. The rate and ejected mass inferred from GW170817 and the EM counterparts are consistent with other observations. We find however that, within simple one zone chemical evolution models (based on merger rates with reasonable delay time distributions as expected from evolutionary models, or from observations of sGRBs), it is difficult to reconcile the current observations of the europium abundance history of Galactic stars for [Fe/H] more then −1. This implies that to account for the role of mergers in the Galactic chemical evolution, we need a Galactic model with multiple populations that have different spatial distributions and/or varying formation rates.

title: Cannonball model diagnosis of the short gamma ray burst 170817A
authors: Shlomo Dado, Arnon Dar, Alvaro De Rujula
topic: The rich and complex data obtained from multi-wavelength observations of SHB170817A, the short hard gamma ray burst (SHB) associated with GW170817 --the first neutron stars merger event detected in gravitational waves (GWs)-- are analyzed in the framework of the cannonball model of SHBs. In this model a highly relativistic jet is launched by fall back matter on the nascent neutron star (or black hole) into a surrounding glory (light from the surrounding wind nebula of the binary neutron stars) which was present already before the merger. The SHB was produced by inverse Compton scattering of glory photons by the jet, which was viewed far off-axis. The fading glory, which produced the initial UVOIR afterglow, was powered by a neutron star remnant. It was overtaken by a late time X-ray, UVOIR and radio afterglow produced by synchrotron radiation from the decelerating jet in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. If the radio afterglow of SHB170817A was indeed produced by the jet, it should display a superluminal motion relative to the SHB location, still detectable in VLA and VLBI radio observations.

authors: Xiang-Yu Wang, Zhi-Qiu Huang
topic: It has been suggested that this mildly relativistic outflow may represent a cocoon of material. We suggest that the velocity gradient profile may form during the stage that the cocoon is breaking out of the merger ejecta, resulted from shock propagation down a density gradient. The cooling of the hot relativistic cocoon material immediately after it breaks out should have produced soft X-ray to UV radiation at tens of seconds to hours after the merger. The soft X-ray emission has a luminosity of 10^45 over a period of tens of seconds for a merger event like GW 170817. The UV emission shows a rise initially and peaks at about a few hours with a luminosity of 10^42

authors: Davide Lazzati, Rosalba Perna, Brian J. Morsony, Diego López-Cámara, Matteo Cantiello, Riccardo Ciolfi, Bruno giacomazzo, Jared C. Workman
topic: Here we show that structured jets with a relativistic, energetic core surrounded by slower and less energetic wings produce afterglow emission that brightens characteristically with time, as recently seen in the afterglow of GW170817. Initially, we only see the relatively slow material moving towards us. As time passes, larger and larger sections of the outflow become visible, increasing the luminosity of the afterglow. The late appearance and increasing brightness of the multi-wavelength afterglow of GW170817 allow us to constrain the geometry of its ejecta and thus reveal the presence of an off-axis jet pointing about 30 degrees away from Earth. Our results confirm a single origin for BNS mergers and short GRBs: GW170817 produced a structured outflow with a highly relativistic core and a canonical short GRB.

title: A more stringent constraint on the mass ratio of binary neutron star merger GW170817
authors: He Gao, Zhoujian Cao, Shunke Ai, Bing Zhang
topic: Here we propose that if one can constrain the dynamical ejecta mass through performing kilonova modeling of the optical/IR data, by utilizing an empirical relation between the dynamical ejecta mass and the mass ratio of NS binaries, one may place a more stringent constraint on the mass ratio of the system. For instance, considering that the red "kilonova" component is powered by the dynamical ejecta, we reach a tight constraint on the mass ratio in the range of 0.46-0.59. Alternatively, if the blue "kilonova" component is powered by the dynamical ejecta, the mass ratio would be constrained in the range of 0.53-0.67. Overall, such a multi-messenger approach could narrow down the mass ratio of GW170817 system to the range of 0.46-0.67, which gives a more precise estimation of the individual NS mass than pure GW signal analysis

title: Prompt emission from the counter jet of a short gamma-ray burst
authors: Ryo Yamazaki, Kunihito Ioka, Takashi Nakamura
topic: The counter jet of a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) has not yet been observed, while recent discoveries of gravitational waves (GWs) from a binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 and the associated sGRB 170817A have demonstrated that off-axis sGRB jets are detectable. We calculate the prompt emission from the counter jet of an sGRB and show that it is typically 23-26 mag in the optical-infrared band 10-10^3 sec after the GWs for an sGRB 170817A-like event, which is brighter than the early macronova (or kilonova) emission and detectable by LSST in the near future. We also propose a new method to constrain the unknown jet properties, such as the Lorentz factor, opening angle, emission radii, and jet launch time, by observing both the forward and counter jets. To scrutinize the counter jets, space GW detectors like DECIGO are powerful in forecasting the merger time (less or equal 1 sec) and position (less or equal 1 arcmin) (similar a week) before the merger.

authors: H. Tong, C. Yu, L. Huang
topic: The gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A associated with GW170817 is subluminous and subenergetic compared with other typical short GRBs. It may be due to a relativistic jet viewed off-axis, or a structured jet, or cocoon emission. Giant flares from magnetars may possibly be ruled out. However, the luminosity and energetics of GRB 170817A is coincident with that of magnetar giant flares. After the coalescence of the binary neutron star, a hypermassive neutron star may be formed. The hypermassive neutron star may have magnetar-strength magnetic field. During the collapse of the hypermassive neutron star, the magnetic field energy will also be released. This giant-flare-like event may explain the the luminosity and energetics of GRB 170817A. Bursts with similar luminosity and energetics are expected in future neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole mergers.

topic: Motivated by such a remarkable progress, we examine the fate of the remnants formed in NS mergers and focus on the roles of the angular momentum and the mass distribution of the binary NSs. In the mass shedding limit (for which the dimensionless angular momentum equals to the Keplerian value, [func] the adopted { seven EoS models, except H4 and ALF2,} yield supramassive NSs in more than half of the mergers. However, for [func]  the presence or absence of a non-negligible fraction of supramassive NSs formed in the mergers depends sensitively on both the EoS and the mass distribution of the binary systems. The NS mergers with a total gravitational mass less 2.6Msun are found to be able to shed valuable light on both the EoS model and the angular momentum of the remnants if supramassive NSs are still absent.

title: Interpreting GRB170817A as a giant flare from a jet-less double neutron-star merger
authors: Om S. Salafia, Gabriele Ghisellini, Giancarlo Ghirlanda, Monica Colpi
topic: We show that the delay between GRB170817A and GW170817 is incompatible with de-beamed emission from an off-axis relativistic jet. The prompt emission and the subsequent radio and X-ray observations can instead be interpreted within a giant-flare-like scenario, being the result of a relativistic outflow driven by the ultra-strong magnetic field produced by magnetohydrodynamic amplification during the merger of the progenitor double neutron-star binary. Within such picture, the data indicate that the outflow must be endowed with a steep velocity profile, with a relatively fast tail extending to Gamma~8.

title: A long-lived remnant neutron star after GW170817 inferred from its associated kilonova
authors: Yun-Wei Yu, Liang-Duan Liu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: However, whether a long-lived remnant NS could be formed during this merger event remains unknown, although such a central engine has been suggested by afterglow observations of some short-duration GRBs. By invoking this long-lived remnant NS, we here propose a model of hybrid energy sources for the kilonova AT2017gfo associated with GW 170817. While the early emission of AT2017gfo is still powered radioactively as usually suggested, its late emission is primarily caused by delayed energy injection from the remnant NS. S. These self-consistent results indicate that a long-lived remnant NS, which must own a very stiff equation of state, had been formed during the merger event of GW170817. This provides a very stringent constraint on the strong interaction in nuclear-quark matter. It is further implied that such GW events could provide a probe of the early spin and magnetic evolutions of NSs, e.g., the burying of surface magnetic fields.

topic: In this paper, we show that the X-ray, optical and radio fluxes are consistent with the synchrotron forward-shock model viewed off-axis when the matter in the outflow is parametrized through a power law velocity distribution. We discuss the origin of the γ-ray peak in terms of internal and external shocks. We show that the γ-ray flux might be consistent with a synchrotron self-Compton reverse-shock model observed at high latitudes. Comparing the best-fit values obtained after describing the γ-ray, X-ray, optical and radio fluxes with our model, we find that the afterglow and γ-ray emission occurred in different regions and also evidence to propose that the progenitor environment was entrained with magnetic fields and therefore, we argue for the presence of the magnetic field amplification in the binary neutron star merger.

authors: Ian M. Shoemaker, Kohta Murase
topic: Using GW170817 as the first GW-EM example, we show that this event provides a stringent direct test that GWs travel at the speed of light. The gravitational potential of the Milky Way provides a potential source of Shapiro time delay difference between the arrival of photons and GWs, and we demonstrate that the nearly coincident detection of the GW and EM signals can yield strong limits on anomalous gravitational time delay, through updating the previous limits taking into account details of Milky Way's gravitational potential. Finally, we also obtain an intriguing limit on the size of the prompt emission region of GRB 170817A, and discuss implications for the emission mechanism of short gamma-ray bursts.

topic: Short duration Gamma Ray Bursts(SGRB) and their afterglows are among the most promising electro-magnetic (EM) counterparts of Neutron Star (NS) mergers. The afterglow emission is broadband, visible across the entire electro-magnetic window from γ-ray to radio frequencies. The flux evolution in these frequencies is sensitive to the multi-dimensional afterglow physical parameter space. Observations of gravitational wave (GW) from BNS mergers in spatial and temporal coincidence with SGRB and associated afterglows can provide valuable constraints on afterglow physics. We run simulations of GW-detected BNS events and assuming all of them are associated with a GRB jet which also produces an afterglow,

topic: Gravitational waves from a merger of two neutron stars (NSs) were discovered for the first time in GW170817, together with diverse electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. To make constraints on a relativistic jet from the NS merger, we calculate the EM signals in (1) the short gamma-ray burst sGRB 170817A from an off-axis jet, (2) the optical-infrared macronova (or kilonova), especially the blue macronova, from a jet-powered cocoon, and (3) the X-ray and radio afterglows from the interaction between the jet and interstellar medium. We find that a typical sGRB jet is consistent with these observations, and there is a parameter space to explain all the observations in a unified fashion

topic: However, it is still unclear which astrophysical site between core-collapse supernovae and neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) mergers produced most of the r-process elements in the universe. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models can test these scenarios by quantifying the frequency and yields required to reproduce the amount of europium (Eu) observed in galaxies. Although NS-NS mergers have become popular candidates, their required frequency (or rate) needs to be consistent with that obtained from gravitational wave measurements. Here we address the first NS-NS merger detected by LIGO/Virgo (GW170817) and its associated Gamma-ray burst and analyze their implication on the origin of r-process elements. This is the first study that directly combines nuclear physics uncertainties with GCE calculations. If GW170817 is a representative event, NS-NS mergers can produce Eu in sufficient amounts and are likely to be the main r-process site.

authors: Gavin P Lamb, Shiho Kobayashi
topic: In this paper, we assume that the γ-ray emission is caused by energy dissipation within a relativistic jet and we model the afterglow synchrotron emission from a reverse- and forward-shock in the outflow. We show the afterglow for a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet with a high Lorentz-factor (Gamma); a low-Gamma and low-kinetic energy jet; a low-Gamma, high kinetic energy jet; structured jets viewed at an inclination within the jet-half-opening angle; and an off-axis `typical' GRB jet. All jet models will produce observable afterglows on various timescales. The late-time afterglow from 10-110 days can be fit by a Gaussian structured jet viewed at a moderate inclination, however, the GRB is not directly reproduced by this model.

title: Estimating the Contribution of Dynamical Ejecta in the Kilonova Associated with GW170817
authors: LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Collaboration
topic: The source of the gravitational-wave signal GW170817, very likely a binary neutron star merger, was also observed electromagnetically, providing the first multi-messenger observations of this type. The two week long electromagnetic counterpart had a signature indicative of an r-process-induced optical transient known as a kilonova. This Letter examines how the mass of the dynamical ejecta can be estimated without a direct electromagnetic observation of the kilonova, using gravitational-wave measurements and a phenomenological model calibrated to numerical simulations of mergers with dynamical ejecta. Specifically, we apply the model to the binary masses inferred from the gravitational-wave measurements, and use the resulting mass of the dynamical ejecta to estimate its contribution (without the effects of wind ejecta) to the corresponding kilonova light curves from various models. The distributions of dynamical ejecta mass range between 10^3 10^2 for various equations of state, assuming the neutron stars are rotating slowly. In addition, we use our estimates of the dynamical ejecta mass and the neutron star merger rates inferred from GW170817 to constrain the contribution of events like this to the r-process element abundance in the Galaxy when ejecta mass from post-merger winds is neglected. We find that if \geq 10% of the matter dynamically ejected from BNS mergers is converted to r-process elements, GW170817-like BNS mergers could fully account for the amount of r-process material observed in the Milky Way.

title: Evidence for Cocoon Emission from the Early Light Curve of SSS17a
authors: Anthony L. Piro, Juna A. Kollmeier
topic: Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the first optical counterpart to the gravitational wave event GW170817. Although its light curve on the timescale of weeks roughly matches the expected luminosity and red color of an r-process powered transient, the explanation for the blue emission from high velocity material over the first few days is not as clear. Here we show that the power-law evolution of the luminosity, temperature, and photospheric radius during these early times can be explained by cooling of shock heated material around the neutron star merger. This heating is likely from the interaction of the gamma-ray burst jet with merger debris, so-called cocoon emission. We summarize the properties of this emission and provide formulae that can be used to study future detections of shock cooling from merging neutron stars. This argues that optical transient surveys should search for such early, blue light if they wish to find off-axis gamma-ray bursts and double neutron star gravitational wave events as soon as possible after the merger.

title: Binary neutron star merger rate via the luminosity function of short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Debdutta Paul
topic: The luminosity function of short Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) is modelled by using the available catalogue data of all short GRBs (sGRBs) detected till October, 2017. The luminosities are estimated via the "pseudo-redshifts" obtained from the "Yonetoku correlation", assuming a standard delay distribution between the cosmic star formation rate and the production rate of their progenitors. While the simple powerlaw is ruled out to high confidence, the data is fit well both by exponential cutoff powerlaw and broken powerlaw models. Using the derived parameters of these models along with conservative values in the jet opening angles seen from afterglow observations, the true rate of short GRBs are derived.

topic: We present our observations of electromagnetic transients associated with GW170817/GRB 170817A using optical telescopes of Chilescope observatory and Big Scanning Antenna (BSA) of Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory at 110MHz. The Chilescope observatory detected an optical transient of \sim 19m on the third day in the outskirts of the galaxy NGC 4993; we continued observations following its rapid decrease. We put an upper limit of 1.5×104 Jy on any radio source with a duration of 10-60 s which may be associated with GW170817/GRB 170817A. The prompt gamma-ray emission consists of two distinctive components - a hard short pulse delayed by \sim 2 seconds with respect to the LIGO signal and softer thermal pulse with T\sim 10 keV lasting for another \sim 2 seconds. The appearance of a thermal component at the end of the burst is unusual for short GRBs. Both the hard and the soft components do not satisfy the Amati relation, making GRB 170817A distinctively different from other short GRBs. Based on gamma-ray and optical observations, we develop a model for the prompt high-energy emission associated with GRB 170817A. The merger of two neutron stars creates an accretion torus of \sim 10−2Msun, which supplies the black hole with magnetic flux and confines the Blandford-Znajek-powered jet. We associate the hard prompt spike with the quasispherical breakout of the jet from the disk wind. As the jet plows through the wind with subrelativistic velocity, it creates a radiation-dominated shock that heats the wind material to tens of kiloelectron volts, producing the soft thermal component.

topic: Here we discuss the role of neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the light of the first direct detection of such an event in both gravitational (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) waves. We analyse bolometric and NIR lightcurves of the first detected double neutron star merger and compare them to nuclear reaction network-based macronova models. The slope of the bolometric lightcurve is consistent with the radioactive decay of neutron star ejecta with Ye≲0.3 (but not larger), which provides strong evidence for an r-process origin of the electromagnetic emission. This rules out in particular "nickel winds" as major source of the emission. We find that the NIR lightcurves can be well fitted either with or without lanthanide-rich ejecta.

Although at similar epochs AT2017gfo appears fainter than every SGRB-associated KN claimed so far, we find three bursts (GRBs 050509B, 061201 and 080905A) where, if the reported redshifts are correct, deep upper limits rule out the presence of a KN similar to AT2017gfo by several magnitudes. Combined with the properties of previously claimed KNe in SGRBs this suggests considerable diversity in the properties of KN drawn from compact object mergers, despite the similar physical conditions that are expected in many NS-NS mergers

title: Repeating and Non-repeating Fast Radio Bursts from Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Shotaro Yamasaki, Tomonori Totani, Kenta Kiuchi
topic: However, the merger environment is polluted by dynamical ejecta, which may prohibit the radio signal to propagate. We examine this by using a general-relativistic simulation of a BNS merger, and show that the ejecta appears about 1 ms after the rotation speed of the merged star becomes the maximum. Therefore there is a time window in which an FRB signal can reach outside, and the short duration of non-repeating FRBs can be explained by screening after ejecta formation. A fraction of BNS mergers may leave a rapidly rotating and stable neutron star, and such objects may be the origin of repeating FRBs like FRB 121102.

Second, we find that the magnetorotational instability in the RMNS envelope and torus with ρ less 10^13 g cm−3 sustains magneto-turbulent state and the effective viscous parameter in these regions is likely to converge to approx 0.01--0.02 with respect to the grid resolution.

authors: Nicole M. Lloyd-Ronning
topic: We investigate the expected radio emission from short GRBs, guided by the observed distributions of their afterglow parameters. Our motivation is to explore the radio signatures of the forward and reverse shock in a sGRB jet, as well as the off-axis jet component and radio emission from the dynamical ejecta. We estimate the fraction of GRBs detectable in the radio that may be coincident with a GW signal from a neutron star (NS) merger. At the distance to which aLIGO at design specification is sensitive to GWs from NS mergers, we may detect up to 20 % of off-axis jet radio components of these events, and up to about 10 % of events with radio emission from the tidal ejecta shocking with the external medium. We discuss our results in light of the Next Generation Very Large Array, expected to make significant progress in detecting radio signals from sGRBs.

We find overwhelming evidence for a bimodal distribution, in agreement with previous literature, and report for the first time positive evidence for a sharp cut-off at a maximum neutron star mass. We obtain a lower bound on the maximum sound speed attained inside the neutron star. Our constraints on the maximum neutron star mass strengthen the case for neutron star-neutron star mergers as the primary source of short gamma-ray bursts.

title: Monte-Carlo closure for moment-based transport schemes in general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics simulations
authors: Francois Foucart
topic:  Photon transport plays a crucial role in radiatively dominated accretion disks, while neutrino transport is critical to core-collapse supernovae and to the modeling of electromagnetic transients and nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. However, evolving the full Boltzmann equations of radiative transport is extremely expensive. Here, we describe the implementation in the general relativistic SpEC code of a cheaper radiation hydrodynamics method which theoretically converges to a solution of Boltzmann's equation in the limit of infinite numerical resources. The algorithm is based on a gray two-moment scheme, in which we evolve the energy density and momentum density of the radiation. Two-moment schemes require a closure which fills in missing information about the energy spectrum and higher-order moments of the radiation. Instead of the approximate analytical closure currently used in core-collapse and merger simulations, we complement the two-moment scheme with a low-accuracy Monte-Carlo evolution. The Monte-Carlo results can provide any or all of the missing information in the evolution of the moments, as desired by the user.

title: Closed-form tidal approximants for binary neutron star gravitational waveforms constructed from high-resolution numerical relativity simulations
authors: Tim Dietrich, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Wolfgang Tichy
topic: We construct closed-form gravitational waveforms (GWs) with tidal effects for the coalescence and merger of binary neutron stars. The method relies on a new set of eccentricity-reduced and high-resolution numerical relativity (NR) simulations and is composed of three steps. First, tidal contributions to the GW phase are extracted from the time-domain NR data. Second, those contributions are employed to fix high-order coefficients in an effective and resummed post-Newtonian expression. Third, frequency-domain tidal approximants are built using the stationary phase approximation. Our tidal approximants are valid from the low frequencies to the strong-field regime and up to merger. They can be analytically added to any binary black hole GW model to obtain a binary neutron star waveform, either in the time or in the frequency domain. This work provides simple, flexible, and accurate models ready to be used in both searches and parameter estimation of binary neutron star events.

topic: We present an improved search for binary compact-object mergers using a network of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We model a volumetric, isotropic source population and incorporate the resulting distribution over signal amplitude, time delay, and coalescence phase into the ranking of candidate events. We describe an improved modeling of the background distribution, and demonstrate incorporating a prior model of the binary mass distribution in the ranking of candidate events. We find a approx 10% and approx 20% increase in detection volume for simulated binary neutron star and neutron star--binary black hole systems, respectively, corresponding to a reduction of the false alarm rates assigned to signals by between one and two orders of magnitude.

title: Structure of Stable Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants: Role of Initial Spin
authors: Wolfgang Kastaun, Riccardo Ciolfi, Andrea Endrizzi, Bruno Giacomazzo
topic: We present general relativistic numerical simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with different initial spin configurations. We focus on models with stars of mass 1.4 M_sol each, which employ the equation of state (EOS) by Shen, Horowitz, and Teige, and which result in stable NSs as merger remnants. We present visualizations of the fluid flow and temperature distribution and find a strong impact of the spin on vortex structure and nonaxisymmetric deformation. We compute the radial mass distribution and the rotation profile in the equatorial plane using recently developed measures independent of spatial gauge, revealing slowly rotating cores that can be well approximated by the cores of spherical stars. We also study the influence of the spin on the inspiral phase and the gravitational wave (GW) signal.

title: Structure of Stable Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants: a Case Study
authors: Wolfgang Kastaun, Riccardo Ciolfi, Bruno Giacomazzo
topic: In this work, we study the merger of two neutron stars with a gravitational mass of 1.4 M_sol each, employing the Shen-Horowitz-Teige equation of state. This equation of state is a corner case, allowing the formation of a stable neutron star with the given total baryonic mass of 3.03 M_sol. We investigate in unprecedented detail the structure of the remnant, in particular the mass distribution, the thermal structure, and the rotation profile. We also compute fluid trajectories both inside the remnant and those relevant for the formation of the disk. We find a peanut-shaped fluid flow inside the remnant following a strong m=2 perturbation. Moreover, the flow is locally compressive, causing the appearance of dynamic hot spots. Further, we introduce new diagnostic measures that are easy to implement in numeric simulations and that allow to quantify mass and compactness of merger remnants in a well-defined way.

title: Possible role of magnetic reconnection in the electromagnetic counterpart of binary black hole merger
authors: F. Fraschetti
topic: We propose a qualitative scenario to interpret the argued association between the direct measurement of the gravitational wave event GW150914 by Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo collaborations and the hard X-ray transient detected by Fermi-Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) 0.4 sec after. In a binary system of two gravitationally collapsing objects with a non-vanishing electric charge, the compenetration of the two magnetospheres occurring during the coalescence, through magnetic reconnection, produces a highly collimated relativistic outflow that becomes optically thin and shines in the GBM field of view. We propose that this process should be expected as a commonplace in the future joint gravitational/electromagnetic detections and, in case of neutron star-neutron star merger event, might lead to detectable X- or γ-ray precursors to, or transients associated with, the gravitational bursts.
