title: Which Stars can see Earth as a Transiting Exoplanet?
authors: L. Kaltenegger, J. Pepper
topic: Transit observations have found the majority of exoplanets to date. Spectroscopic observations of transits and eclipses are the most commonly used tool to characterize exoplanet atmospheres and will be used in the search for life. However, an exoplanet's orbit must be aligned with our line of sight to observe a transit. Here we ask, from which stellar vantage points would a distant observer be able to search for life on Earth in the same way?
We use the TESS Input Catalog and data from Gaia DR2 to identify the closest stars that could see Earth as a transiting exoplanet: We identify 1,004 Main Sequence stars within 100 parsecs, of which 508 guarantee a minimum 10-hour long observation of Earth's transit. Our star list consists of about 77% M-type, 12% K-type, 6% G-type, 4% F-type stars, and 1% A-type stars close to the ecliptic. SETI searches like the Breakthrough Listen Initiative are already focusing on this part of the sky. Our catalog now provides a target list for this search. As part of the extended mission, NASA's TESS will also search for transiting planets in the ecliptic to find planets that could detect life on our transiting Earth as well.

title: The Sun Diver: Combining solar sails with the Oberth effect
authors: Coryn A.L. Bailer-Jones 
topic: A highly reflective sail provides a way to propel a spacecraft out of the solar system using solar radiation pressure. The closer the spacecraft is to the Sun when it starts its outward journey, the larger the radiation pressure and so the larger the final velocity. For a spacecraft starting on the Earth's orbit, closer proximity can be achieved via a retrograde impulse from a rocket engine. The sail is then deployed at the closest approach to the Sun. Employing the so-called Oberth effect, a second, prograde, impulse at closest approach will raise the final velocity further. Here I investigate how a fixed total impulse ({\Delta}v) can best be distributed in this procedure to maximize the sail's velocity at infinity. Once {\Delta}v exceeds a threshold that depends on the lightness number of the sail (a measure of its sun-induced acceleration), the best strategy is to use all of the {\Delta}v in the retrograde impulse to dive as close as possible to the Sun. Below the threshold the best strategy is to use all of the {\Delta}v in the prograde impulse and thus not to dive at all. Although larger velocities can be achieved with multi-stage impulsive transfers, this study shows some interesting and perhaps counter-intuitive consequences of combining impulses with solar sails.

title: The Orbital Mechanics of Space Elevator Launch Systems
authors: Matthew M. Peet
topic: The construction of a space elevator would be an inspiring feat of planetary engineering of immense cost and risk. But would the benefit outweigh the costs and risks? What, precisely, is the purpose for building such a structure? For example, what if the space elevator could provide propellant-free (free release) orbital transfer to every planet in the solar system and beyond on a daily basis? In our view, this benefit might outweigh the costs and risks. But can a space elevator provide such a service? In this manuscript, we examine 3 tiers of space elevator launch system design and provide a detailed mathematical analysis of the orbital mechanics of spacecraft utilizing such designs. We find the limiting factor in all designs is the problem of transition to the ecliptic plane. For Tiers 1 and 2, we find that free release transfers to all the outer planets is possible, achieving velocities far beyond the ability of current Earth-based rocket technology, but with significant gaps in coverage due to planetary alignment. For Tier 3 elevators, however, we find that fast free release transfers to all planets in the solar system is possible on a daily basis. Finally, we show that Tier 2 and 3 space elevators can potentially use counterweights to perform staged slingshot maneuvers, providing a velocity multiplier which could dramatically reduce transit times to outer planets and interstellar destinations.

title: Solar One: A Proposal for The First Crewed Interstellar Spacecraft
authors: Alberto Caballero
topic: In this paper it is presented the concept and design of a new type of spacecraft that could be used to make the first manned interstellar travel. Solar one would integrate three near-term technologies, namely: the US Navy CFR fusion reactor, a larger version of NASA Sunjammer light sail, and an array of DE-STAR laser systems. A system of Fresnel lenses and flexible mirrors to propel the sail with sunlight is suggested as an alternative to this array. With a mile-long light sail, Solar One could reach an average of 22% the speed of light, arriving to the closest potentially habitable exoplanet in less than 19 years with the help of a Bussard scoop. Key challenges are reducing the weight of continuous-wave lasers and compact fusion reactors as well as achieving cryo-sleep and artificial gravity.
